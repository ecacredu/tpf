        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Ved Vyas?’ Ved was shocked. ‘Was it really him?’</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘The one who protects the <i>Granth</i> hears instructions in his head. I listen to those too. It is said that they
            are given by Maharishi Ved Vyas.’ Yug clarified.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved sensed another <i>maybe </i>in that sentence. Yug was not certain whether the voice he claimed to hear was of
            Ved Vyas or merely his inner conscious or another miracle by the book itself.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Oh Brahmin you said you have been searching for Ved Vyas since five centuries now. Have you met him at least once?’
            Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘As I have told you before it is not easy to meet Ved Vyas.’ Yug replied. ‘I have not, but I want to and very close
            to, is what I feel.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Bzzt… Bzzzzzzt… Bzzzt… Ved looked at his cell vibrating cell phone. Disha was trying to call him continuously since
            last few minutes. It had been around six hours since Disha had left and Yug came to his room.</p>
        
        <p class="pageHeading para">Even after his text messages, she was persistently calling him. Though her calls and messages were disturbing the
            conversation. ‘She must be worrying’ Ved thought.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Though he hadn't made up his strangling mind for going with Yug completely and was not up to a decision, he finally
            picked up her call. ‘Hello.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Ved!’ Disha Yelled. Her voice felt afraid yet silent. ‘I tried to call you so many times.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What happened Disha?’ Ved asked on his cell phone. ‘I had messaged you that I will give you a callback.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">She suddenly went silent and slowly said. ‘Listen carefully Ved. And do not ask further questions.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was surprised for the sudden tone change. He was keen to hear what she would say. ‘Yes. I am listening.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved’s eyes widened as he heard what Disha said.’Has Yug reached there?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was shocked. ‘What? But how do you even…’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Stay silent and don’t let him notice I am telling this. Just listen.’ Disha said. ‘Do not trust him. He is a con
            man and don’t believe a word of what he says.’</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But Disha… ’ Call disconnected before Ved could complete his sentence. Ved felt a deep shock at that very moment.
            He was speechless for few seconds.</p>
        
        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved looked at Yug and pretended to continue talking. ‘But Disha, I am busy right now. Can't come at this moment.’
            He paused a bit. ‘Ok, Do as you want!’ He pretended to disconnect the call from his end.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Who is Disha?’ Yug asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was shocked and was still not out of what he heard on his phone. ‘How the hell does Disha even know about Yug?’
            Ved asked to himself. ‘And how does she judge that he is a con-man?’ He thought while looking at Yug.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">But Ved had to reply to his question. ‘She is a friend… Was asking me out for dinner…’ he mumbled as he spoke.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug now looked at Ved suspiciously. ‘Oh yes… You have missed your dinner time.’ Yug said changing the topic. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved wanted to make things look normal. ‘Oh Nevermind… Where were we?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I had told you that I hear voices of Maharishi Ved Vyas inside me and that I am instructed to take you to our village,
            Vrukshavrundavan’ Yug answered.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As Yug was speaking, Ved seemed to come back to reality again. Yug had said that he didn’t meet Vyas even once. Yug
            seemed convicted, but it also meant that <i>Maharishi</i> <i>Vyas</i> could just not exist. Was Mahabharata even
            real? Or was it just a story? If it was real is the author of Mahabharata, Maharishi Vyas still alive? Ved’s
            couldn’t just grab hold of his thoughts.</p>

         <p class="pageHeading para">Disha’s words were continuously revolving in Ved’s head. ‘How does Disha even know him?’ he thought again.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Now Ved’s mind was filled with suspicion. ‘How can you be so sure it is him? Maharishi Vyas that you say you hear
            inside you.’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘The intensive knowledge that the one who instructs me has, points that it is him.’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Again Ved did not get a straight answer to his question. ‘But he could not be Vyas?’ Ved asked. ‘There is a possibility,
            isn’t it?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What do you want to point at?’ Yug asked. ‘Do you not believe that Maharishi Vyas is alive?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was stunned. Yug asked it too directly. Ved replied, ‘I didn’t mean it in that way of sage. But what if all this
            is just a coincidence?’ Yug seemed too much confident on the existence of Vyas.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No it is not. I am sure you will get answers to most of your questions as we reach to my village.’ Yug seemed persistent.
            Ved now saw through it.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Will I get to know how I escaped death from those barbaric tribals? Or who would have killed my friends?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes. As we reach there, I will arrange our meeting with the head of my clan. I am sure he will help you as much
            as he can.’ Yug replied.</p>
            <p class="pageHeading para">Some pieces of the puzzle were still missing. As Ved thought he started getting more confused. Yug had only answered
            those questions which were associated with his story that Ved had told him. ‘All the explanations could altogether
            be fake like Disha said’ Ved thought. ‘There was a possibility that Yug could be a con.’</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">Every time Ved looked at Yug, he remembered Disha’s words. Maybe he was being followed by Yug right from the start.
            Maybe all the answers are well planned as well.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What took you so long to find me?’ Ved asked. ‘Considering your agility and magic, could you not have found me earlier?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug was surprised by such sudden question, but he replied instantly. ‘I searched for you everywhere. It took me seven
            days to figure out that your location, after which I met you.’ He paused. ‘Also magic, as I said, is just a higher
            application of science and can't do everything, Everyone who does it has his mastery in a particular field.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As the conversation was heading ahead, Ved was getting more and more doubtful. ’When do we plan to leave tomorrow?’
            Ved asked considering to plan how much time has left to rebel. He knew in physical combat; he won't be able to
            do anything to Yug and least what he could do is postpone the going to the next day and figure out something.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">But resisting it, Yug replied. ‘No, we have less time. Now that I am here, They can find us at any moment. We should
            leave now itself as soon as possible.’</p>
            <p class="pageHeading para">He had answered as expected and it grew Ved’s suspicion even further. The mysterious Brahmin told him everything
            related to what he can make on his own and Ved couldn't question on.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But I am very tired right now. I think I need some rest.’ Ved said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug noticed a sudden change in Ved’s behavior. ‘What is it that you heard on the phone?’ Yug asked as he had naturally
            sensed the sudden tonality and attitude change of Ved towards him.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No. What about the phone?’ Ved was nervous now. He was caught he thought.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Ved. Carry no doubt that I am on the side of truth.’ Yug said. ‘I do not know what you heard on the phone. But you
            seem nervous.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved decided to bluff him. ‘Oh Brahmin, it is not the phone. I still carry doubt on being the chosen one that you
            say.’
        </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">There was a long silence. Breaking it, Yug suddenly went off-topic and asked. ‘When you left the hotel. You had got
            rid of the manuscript, hadn’t you?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved just gazed at Yug. It was something that he had not told to him yet. He nodded.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug continued. ‘After leaving the hotel, you stopped the car near a jungle and had buried the manuscript. You left
            the manuscript considering it a curse.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was surprised. ‘How does he know it?’ Ved thought.</p>
        
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You went ahead. You could have just got rid of it. But you reversed the car, came back and took it back!’ Yug said.</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes, I did.’ Ved said. ‘How does it matter over here?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You took it back not because it was a precious research material.’ Yug continued. ‘But because you did not want
            anyone else to suffer like what had you went through.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved’s eyes widened. He had not told a part of it to Yug, but he knew everything. ‘Was I seriously being followed
            right from the start?’ Ved thought. ‘But he could have found me sooner, in that case, there was no reason to
            wait for such long to approach me. Also if it were just the book, he would have just taken it and vanished.’
            Ved wondered. But not only about his actions, but Yug had also told him about how and what he felt while taking
            the manuscript back.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You do not understand yourself. Please have faith in me and come along.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved looked at his cell phone. ‘Do not believe a single word of he says’ was said by Disha. Firstly, Disha had no
            reason to even know about Yug. Furthermore, she instructed Ved prominently to do something. This was the first
            time she had done something like this. She surely was strange. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">But there was also another explanation to it. ‘Maybe everything is just an illusion. Yug himself… Disha’s call. Maybe
            I seriously need psychiatric attention.’ Ved thought.</p>
            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved remembered the moment when he was attacked by the local tribals when he had got the book. He had closed his eyes
            expecting everything to end, but that is where everything practically started.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved did the same. Amidst his conversation with Yug, he closed his eyes expecting everything to end. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘TINNNNNGG TONGGGGG’ The bell rang.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved opened his eyes. He still saw Yug in front of him. He regretted it being the truth. He slowly walked to the door
            and opened it. It was Disha.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved looked at her. He had a lot of questions for her. Confirming that Yug was not peeking from inside, Ved whispered.
            ‘What did you say on the call? Why do you think so? And How do you even know him?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was shocked on Disha’s reply. ‘What call? You were not picking up the call… That’s why I came back here.</p>
