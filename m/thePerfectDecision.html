        <h1 class="pageHeading">The Perfect Decision</h1>
        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was disappointed. All his excitement and enthusiasm was drained all of a sudden. The <i>Brahmin</i> standing
            in front of him was not whom he expected him to be. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Then this manuscript…’ Ved continued pleading. ‘Is it not Mahabharata?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No.’ ‘It is my clan’s treasure. We can summon Maharishi Vyas if we have this manuscript.’ Said the sage.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But the title, Granth Vyas?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘That name has a deep history. I will tell you in depth some day. It is not Mahabharata itself, but you can consider
            it a derivative.’ Yug said looking at Ved’s disappointed face.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He further continued. ‘I apologize for your disappointment. But The Mahabharata is too vast to be compiled in a single
            book and meeting Maharishi is not that easy. It has been more than five centuries since even I am myself searching
            for him.'</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Five… Five Centuries?’ Ved was startled. ‘What is your age oh great sage?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘More than five centuries.’ Yug smiled and joyfully indicated Ved about the irrelevancy of his question.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved smiled and perceived the response. He understood that the things are not as usual as it seemed. Yug claimed to
            have lived more than five centuries, but he said he is not immortal. Mortality is when you can die and free yourself
            from the material world. He further asked. ‘Could you answer one last question of mine?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What is it?’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘How were my friends resurrected? Can the dead be brought back to life? Or was it just an illusion or a dream?’ Ved
            asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No… From what I understand, <i>It was neither reality nor a dream</i>.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What do you mean by that?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Give me some time. I will explain to you.’ </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug sat down while taking the manuscript in his hand. He sat in the lotus position and keeping a palm of his on the
            book, started meditating. After few minutes, Ved realized that Yug was in extreme state of focus. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As Ved looked at the Sage meditating and seeking for answers which Ved wanted for himself, he also thought about
            how disappointed he was because the sage is not Ved Vyas. Meanwhile, he saw his phone. Disha was trying to call
            him. But as he did not want him to disturb the process anywhere at this moment in time, he canceled the call
            again and texted her that he will call her in some time.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">To disturb the silence of quiet atmosphere of that room, Yug opened his eyes and said calmly. ‘It was a perfect decision.'
            </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘huh?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Looking at confused Ved. Yug said. ‘It was a glimpse of a possible future that you saw.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was clueless of what he meant. ‘Can you please elaborate?'</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Looking at tangled Ved, Yug continued. ‘You had a choice Ved. To believe or not to believe. Had you not believed
            what you saw, it would have just disappeared. And then.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved looked dumbfounded as he had no idea of what he was hearing. Yug then started telling him the alternative sequence
            of event that would have occurred based on his choice of Ved’s decision.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p style="font-size:1.3rem"># # # # #</p>
            </div>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As he saw dead bodies of his former subordinates, Ved felt paralyzed. It was not just a murder. Their heads were
            brutally pulled off their spine. By applying any logic, It cannot be an act of a human. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Should I stay or run away?’ he thought.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Amongst that stingy smell of dead bodies, he sat there for half an hour. Numb and Paralysed. He wasn’t able to grab
            hold of the situation. ‘What can be done at this stage?’ he thought</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Maybe I should call the police.’ Considering his situation, he was a very well-known archaeologist. He had enough
            political and legal support to save him in court. ‘Nobody can sack me for an inhuman act, that I haven’t even
            done.’ Ved thought.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He called his lawyer and told him everything. The lawyer instructed him to call the police and tell them everything
            as it is and that he is leaving the US for India and will take care of everything once he arrives.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was about to do the same. But first, he thought to collect others witnesses to see it as well. He wanted to make
            them sure of what has happened. He left the bloodshed room as it is and started walking to the reception. As
            he left, everyone was looking at him as if they already know he’s the suspect.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">It was a hard time walking. Ved was continuously haunted by the vision of the subordinates. He reached the reception
            to find the manager sitting there.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Hello,’ he shivered as he spoke. ‘Could you please come with me to my room. I have something show to you.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Manager busy with his call earlier looked at him, seemed shocked but relieved. ‘Sir you are here? Where did you go
            by yourself yesterday night?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was shocked. He was speechless. He preferred to say nothing.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">The manager addressed his discomfort. He chose to divert the topic. ‘Your room sir? Also, others are searching for
            you since yesterday? Have you talked to them?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He again chose to remain silent as he knew no longer can they search for him. ‘Please come with me.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved and the manager started walking back to the room. Ved also insisted two other staff members, to come with them.
            </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As they reached the room, Ved was traumatized. ‘Am I possessed?’ Ved thought. There was nothing. Everything was clean
            and neat. No bloodshed. No dead bodies. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What is it sir?’ asked the manager. What do you wish to show us? Any problem with the room service sir? ‘</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Did someone just clean the suite?’ Ved said as he saw a blurry vision in front of him. ‘I didn’t do anything’ he
            mumbled and felt unconscious.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">……… … ...</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Ved! Ved get up bro!’ said a familiar voice. ‘What have you done to yourself?’ Ved heard as he came back to consciousness.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He was on his bed, surrounded by the manager, his subordinates and a person with a stethoscope hanging around his
            neck.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘He hasn’t eaten since yesterday. Also, dehydrated. It is certain; he will be weak.’ Said the doctor.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘We will take care of him, Doctor.’ Steve said. ‘We had our flight back today to the US, but guess we’ve missed it.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Well, he will be okay now.’ Said the doctor. He then talked with others a bit, gave necessary instructions and got
            out of the room.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">After some time, Ved got up and got hold of the situation. ‘It was just an illusion’ he declared to himself. They
            are live and alive.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Hey… You should rest! And next time you are not going anywhere alone.’ Said his roommate, rushing back to him quickly.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes, I won't.’ He said remembering his death scene.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">After taking some rest, he got fresh and said to Steve. ‘I have something to show to you guys. Call everyone Steve’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Steve followed his team leader's orders and did the same. The most he thought about how he can help in the situation
            was to listen to what Ved was saying.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Meanwhile, Ved called his lawyer and told him that he was playing a prank on him and that he did not need to worry.
            He even made Steve talk to him. He was convinced that it was a joke, and they had their part of laughs. Things
            seemed to line up pretty well as time was passing.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As everyone came to the room, they looked at Ved as he opened his handbag and took the manuscript out of it. ‘This
            is what I found yesterday.’ He said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He told them the entire story of how he started his expedition from old ruins, then just for the sake of it went
            a bit ahead to find the old Aghori who mysteriously smiled at him. Then, the majestic view Shiva sculpture and
            hence the temple. The ear-splitting sound, him finding the book and hence the wild tribal running, towards him
            to kill him.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But how did you escape it?’ Steve asked. ‘How did you reach here? It’s practically impossible bro.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I don’t know.’ Ved said. ‘Also, doesn’t matter now. I am here’ he said asking him to ignore it.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Granth Vyas.’ Hussain read, who was undergoing his archaeological and literature training under Ved currently. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Every one of them was with Ved in his literature and cultural expeditions. Everyone was culture-aware in himself
            and got self-understanding of what the book was. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘It looks pretty old, at least a century bro.’ Steve said to Ved. ‘Is it really Mahabharata?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No it’s older. Look at this chemical formulation.’ Ved said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘This gold trace resembles to shape of a hand.’ Peter added. ‘And these pages, they are so well engineered.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved smiled. ‘Yes.’ He said. ‘We are going to be famous. Very famous.’ Ved yawned.’ Anyways, I am exhausted now; will
            rest again for a moment and then hand this over to Indian embassy. Our lawyers will ensure we get a significant
            amount for the same.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes, I hope we do. But we never know what government would do. Indian government I have heard is full of politics.
            Will they even consider us bro?’ Steve asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Let’s see for tomorrow. Let’s take rest.’ Ved replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Everyone went to his particular room. They were all happy and excited for what was going to happen the next day.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved went into a deep sleep. It was probably one of the most satisfactory and peaceful nights of his life. He had
            no regrets or worries. But amidst the dark tiring night, lights in a room parallel to his were still on. Three
            people held a personal meeting. They were nervous about how things will go if The Mahabharata was handed to Indian
            Embassy. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">The three knew the importance of the manuscript and wanted it to be given to Archaeological Department in the United
            States, where they studied presently. They knew they would be getting a lot more fame and money if they do it.
            One of them also suggested that they should sell the manuscript in the black market.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">They even called people across the globe to find out a possible escape out of the situation. After a long meeting,
            their greed turned fearless and insane. They drew the conclusion that Ved had enough power and rights legally
            to not listen to anything that they will say. Stealing and selling it in black market was not feasible as well.
            So they decided to take a life instead.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As the three came to the room where Ved was sleeping, Peter held a pillow in his hand and was prepared to kill Ved
            to death. Steve and Hussain were ready for any unexpected event that might be encountered.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p style="font-size:1.3rem"># # # # #</p>
            </div>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved looked at his mobile phone. Disha was still calling him continuously. It was obvious for her to get disturbed,
            But Ved was still into Yug.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ignoring the call, he said. ‘This can’t be true. It’s impossible.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I have no reason to lie to you. Do I?’ Yug, knew that Ved wouldn’t believe him. ‘Listen to everything. What I am
            telling were a possible sequence of the events as I told you.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What happened next?’ Ved decided to ignore every thought and just listen.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘That’s all till which I was able to see clearly. Afterward, All I saw was sheer darkness, and all I could hear was
            death. And then… ‘ Yug continued</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p style="font-size:1.3rem"># # # # #</p>
            </div>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As Ved opened his eyes, It was blurry. His forged eyes barely agreed to open. It was dim. The mild, soothing lights
            gave him a <i>Deja Vu</i>. He felt as if he had seen all this earlier. For some reason, his heart started racing,
            and he had terrible fear in his mind.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He widened his eyes. ‘What is this feeling? I sense death.' </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">His nose suddenly noticed a sickening, pungent and stinking smell. He got up intolerably and coughed. Just when he
            was feeling relieved, terrible pain stuck his mind again, on what he saw.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘AAAAAhhh’ He screamed. Every cell in his body was horrified.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Chills went through him as he saw Steve, Hussain, and Peter lying down beside his bed. They had ruthlessly been murdered.
            They were headless, lying in blood. Blood was spilled everywhere on walls and throughout the room. Their heads
            were mercilessly thrown beside them. </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p style="font-size:1.3rem"># # # # #</p>
            </div>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug said. ‘You would have wished for it to be a dream again, that you wake up from. But that time, it would have
            been a reality, and you would have no other option, but to regret.’ </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was alarmed. ‘You mean I saw, what I was going to see on the next day?’ He said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘As I said, it was neither reality nor an illusion. It was a glimpse of a possible future.’ Yug said smilingly. Looking
            at terrified Ved, he continued ‘Which you avoided by your decision to believe that the power of the manuscript
            is above human intervention.’</p>
