              <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;What have you done?&rsquo; looking at the cursed book, he yelled it. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">There was no scope of him not being blamed for what had happened. He had no shred of doubt that he will either go behind bars or will be sentenced to death. All his reputation, his awards now seemed powerless. He knew he will lose it all. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">His common sense told him to leave. He looked at the book and decided to leave it aside. He got hold of his bag and found it to be very light.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Its empty&rsquo; he thought.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He remembered that he had put out all the stuff along with his passport in that cave. &lsquo;I was there. It was real.&rsquo; He thought all those dreadful memories came back together. He also got sight of those wildings approaching him.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Should I take it with me or not?&rsquo; He thought looking at the book.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He knew its worth. It was a national treasure. His archaeological concise instructed him to put it in his bag. He did so. Changing his blood shed clothes, he got ready to leave. Also he caught hold of his other stuff, packed it in another bag and prepared to leave.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He put his traveller backpack on his back. Pulling his handbag which consisted the book, he came towards the door. For once he turned back and saw the dreadful view. The blood painted room made him turn his eyes down. It was more gloomy than anything. He turned back again and closed the door silently without touching it with his hands.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved came down the hotel stairway, to find that everyone was staring at him. Everyone had their piece of question for him it seemed. But they didn&rsquo;t say anything. May be because of his get up he thought. He prefered to ignored everyone and went to counter. He knew others saw him, so even in that horrible situation he had to behave normal.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">But the vision of his dead subordinates was still haunting him. He shivered as he spoke. &lsquo;I want to check out.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Manager busy with his call earlier looked at him, seemed shocked but relieved &lsquo;Sir you are here? Where did you go by yourself yesterday night?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was shocked. He was speechless. He prefered to say nothing.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Manager addressed his discomfort. He chose to divert the topic by himself. &lsquo;At this time sir? It&rsquo;s 9 PM. Even if you leave where will you go? Hotel room not comfortable sir?&rsquo; said the manager.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was stunned. 9 PM? He took out his cell phone and checked the date. His eyes widened. He was sleeping for the whole day.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;And.. Are you leaving alone sir? What about your colleagues? You had a conversation with them right? All ok now?&rsquo; </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;No! They aren&rsquo;t coming with me&rsquo; he was quick. Gathering courage to speak further, he said &lsquo;Please take this card. I will find some way. I have an extreme emergency and have to go. And, Yes of course, I have had a talk with them.&rsquo; he signalled him to use his card.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He swiped his card and took his leave from hotel. He surely wasn&rsquo;t gonna go to his own house. As he would be first searched over there. He travelled to Nashik, a city in Maharashtra at his grandfather&rsquo;s apartment. Continuing to live in fear, he was meanwhile researching on the book. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He knew by now, the bodies would be discovered and the cops would be searching for him. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">His grandfather&rsquo;s place was safe. It was locked for several years and only he had the keys for the same. He locked himself there as nobody will notice him. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Nobody knew about this flat as he was an adopted son and had no documentation for the same. His parents left him alone very soon and he was raised by his grandfather who was also an archaeologist. Nobody except for his close friend Disha actually knew about this place. </p>

            <div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p style="font-size:1.3rem"># # # # #</p>
            </div>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;I know Disha, It's hard to believe but I seriously didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rsquo; Ved struggled. &lsquo;Please trust me&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Disha was startled. She got hold of matter. She actually got answers to all her questions together on why he was behaving strange. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Just a moment Ved&rsquo; She took out her phone. She started dialing some number.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Please don't call the cops. Nobody would believe me. I am sure of it.&rsquo; Ved pled, but couldn&rsquo;t stop her.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Hello, you there? Yes I am his grandfather&rsquo;s place now. I was right. He is here.&rsquo; Disha talked on phone to the recipient. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved, felt very alone. He knew he would be held guilty. But he was anyways gonna be caught someday or the other.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Yes he&rsquo;s fine and sitting in front of me. He&rsquo;s fine.&rsquo; She continued.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Yes talk to him.&rsquo; She raised the phone towards him. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He was already feeling uneasy and signalled that he doesn't want to take the call.. He was not going to talk to anyone. Nobody in this world would trust him. After current sequence of events, he even doubted if Disha believed him. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;No&rsquo; he shook his head again in discomfort.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She held the phone aside for a moment, came closer to him and said &lsquo;This is important for you, Ved. Please do it&rsquo;. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He was not gonna listen to her. She forced the phone to his ears.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Ved, What the hell bro?&rsquo; said a familiar with gruffness in it&rsquo;s voice.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was astounded. It was Steve. He couldn&rsquo;t respond. He was speechless. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Please reply bro? What are you doing there? Why did you leave us alone there?&rsquo; Steve said.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved had no words. He was happy he heard his voice. &lsquo;What the hell is happening?&rsquo; he wondered. He was utterless. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">After all the sequence of events, escaping from death, then seeing his friends dead and having the dreadful escape, what he finds out is this. He couldn&rsquo;t reply much to him. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Hey&rsquo; he said whispering. &lsquo;I am fine bro. How are others?&rsquo; He asked reassuringly.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Obviously they are fine? How are you? When can we meet?&rsquo; Steve asked his set of questions.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Oh that's relieving. Listen, stuck somewhere. Will call you back in sometime.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved disconnected the call and looked at Disha with perplexed mind. &lsquo;What is this? What&rsquo;s happening to me?&rsquo; he cried.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Please calm down Ved. I will tell you everything.&rsquo; She tried to comfort him. &lsquo;Nobody is dead. They were there itself, searching for you. You went missing. They searched you everywhere Ved.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;They had informed manager to call them if you come back to hotel.&rsquo; She paused. &lsquo;But to contradict, you came from inside the hotel and checked out.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He was still confused. She continued &lsquo;To make you believe, I called him. It was my last try, coming here. But I found you. Everything is alright Ved. Please let&rsquo;s go back. The world is not behind you, but waiting for you.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was still paralysed. Again some pieces of puzzle were missing. Looking in her eyes he asked &lsquo;I seriously went through all of it Disha, do you actually believe me?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Her eyes were clear, they showed disbelief. &lsquo;Please calm down Ved. I know there is something fishy. I trust you. You left the hotel at night and didn&rsquo;t come back. When asked for, None of the hotel staff saw you coming back to hotel. But you directly came from your room and checked out.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Exactly, You see&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;I do. How did you get back to hotel? When did you get back to hotel?&rsquo; She tried to convince him.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Disha. I seriously don&rsquo;t know anything.&rsquo; He was serious he didn't know anything on what happened, but he appreciated her concern &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s ok. The facts show that I need a psychiatric consultancy. Could you do me a favour?&rsquo; He asked reassuringly.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;No it's not that Ved. You need rest, that&rsquo;s it. And, sure, what do you want?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;I now know I am out of danger. I feel relieved. I will talk back to you at night. Can you leave me alone for sometime.&rsquo; He insisted.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She knew Ved was sensible enough to understand things. She felt it is ok to let him have his space. &lsquo;Ok. I understand your concern. I am staying in the hotel on opposite road for today. We leave back tomorrow morning?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Yes sure.&rsquo; He nodded. She cleaned the place a bit to make it livable. &lsquo;Your grandfather was a pretty good archeologist.&rsquo; She said looking at his awards in the hall showcase and went towards the door.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Your grandfather would have been proud of you today&rsquo; she said. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">They both smiled at each other. Seeing her leave, he rushed back to the research room. Glazing at the book, he asked &lsquo;What are you? What do you want from me?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">But now, his mind was free. He started his research work in full swing as he thought its best way to divert his mind. Steve and others were fine, he was happy.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He looked at his current research progress. He then immediately called several people from university and sent them samples for decoding. There were strange things about the book. The writing seemed to be written in multiple slots of time. One slot he even estimated to be more than 3 centuries old and others were relatively as fresh as hundred years. It looked as if someone was still writing the book. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">This acknowledged the myth that, the author of Mahabharat, &lsquo;Ved Vyas&rsquo; is assumed to be immortal. Was it really Vyas? Or may be hereditary generation to generation passing of the book, who were continuing to write the literature. But why would anyone continue to write Mahabharat? Is it really Mahabharat?</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">But, to contradict this point, as per his handwriting analysis, he was stunned. it seemed to be entirely written by same person. The analysis also displayed personal traits like fearlessness and freedom.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">It was really strange. If his research went successful and if he could prove that the book is actually Mahabharat then it could put light on a lot of facts about hindu mythology.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">These things were too messy to be thought of together. He looked at his wrist watch. It was already night. He wanted to research more, but in the cloudy weather, the rainy thunders were distracting him. May be I should stop my work, he thought as Disha was waiting for him. He decided to reserve the research work for later and commence for home.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Just when he was about to get up. He felt someone standing behind him in the balcony. This feeling was similar to one he felt in his dream cum reality and when he had heard the jolt sound near the standing stone lit with lamp. He instantly turned back with expectations to find no one again, but this time he was really there.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">The powerful dark figure in the moonlight was looking dreadful. The door was closed and there was no other way for a person to come other than windows or balcony.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Standing in his balcony on 9th floor. Dressed like an ancient hindu sage, the mysterious dark figure in silhouettes said in a calm comforting voice </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;This book belongs to me.&rsquo; </p>
