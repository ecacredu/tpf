              <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;What? You found what?&rsquo; exclaimed Disha in disbelief.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He remained silent. He had carefully wrapped it with proper strings in a neat red cloth. He started unpacking the book. &lsquo;I packed it and put it in when you knocked the door, so that nobody finds out what I was upto.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He unpacked it carefully. Disha was astonished. The book was large and looked ancient. It was almost made of bark, with a well organized binding coated around. The book had traces of gold on it, whose shape resembled a hand. She could tell it even in candle light, the gold was best of its kind.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s written here?&rsquo; she asked pointing her finger towards book title.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Granth Vyas&rsquo; Ved said impactfully.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She further opened the book and was amazed to see some pages had golden scripts on it. It was not practically possible. It&rsquo;s pages were literally made of thin finely sliced wood which gave it a real grungy feel.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He told her that according to his knowledge Mahabharat was narated by Maharishi Vyas in 3rd to 4th BCE.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Are we serious?&rsquo; asked Disha. &lsquo;What does the book say? Is it really it?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The script is too old to understand or interpret that easily.&rsquo; he said.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Also just look here.&rsquo; He slightly rubbed over the cream colored grungy page. &lsquo;This fine quality ; As per my knowledge, these are handmade. Also just see the quality of ink. The chemical formulation is so good that it will easily sustain another century. &rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She was just looking at him. Disha believed in such things and already was convinced for it to be Mahabharat. She asked &lsquo;When will you be able to translate it?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She thought for a while. &lsquo;This will be one of the world&rsquo;s most treasured scripts ever! &rsquo; she exclaimed. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She gazed at him as he looked at her with his cold eyes.&rsquo;Why are you so stressed. It should be a happy moment, shouldn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; She came back to her original question.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He was shocked. All the forgotten memories came back to life and his facial excitement turned to grief and fear. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything Disha. I don&rsquo;t know on anything how it all happened.&rsquo; He mumbled.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She was still confused. She saw sudden stillness. He had no practical reason to be so depressed. &lsquo;What happened? You tell me, why are you hiding here in this old apartment?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He looked at her. He had turned sweaty. But he continued.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p style="font-size:1.3rem"># # # # #</p>
            </div>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He couldn&rsquo;t believe it. In that dense dark cave, his cheer echoed everywhere. He was suddenly energized. Like a small kid, he started turning those grubby pages. He was amazed and excited. The content inside was not as understandable as the title, though. The language used was very old and would need additional knowhow. He tried to push it into his traveller backpack. The book was too big to fit in with current items. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He tried harder to force it in, but was unsuccessful.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;bluhh Bluhh BLUhh&rsquo; the tribal sounds were coming closer. They were closer now. Their voice resonated through the cave. Fear stuck his mind. Without second thoughts he inverted the bag and emptied it. He pushed the book half inside and waved the bag on his back. Getting hold of the torch, he started running back towards the entrance.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">The tribal people were still making those horrifying recursive sounds indicating their discomfort towards unknown. They were disturbing animals and birds further which were adding to their noises as well.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Being tensed, Ved tried to run as fast as possible. He came near the entrance to see that it had started snowing. He leaned out of the cave to see them all. His eyes popped out. Even in that dark snowy night, fearlessly hundreds of tribals were running towards him. They had their weapons in their hand. Some had held handmade fire torches and others were holding metal knifes and bones.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">His senses were stunned. He looked back, but he knew he would be cornered inside anyways.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He tried to run aside but they were everywhere, approaching him from every direction. Even from this distance he could feel their blood thirst. They were angry and afraid for the intervention.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">The throbbing sound was furious enough for them to think that they were in danger. For them it might simply be a bad omen. Though Ved couldn't be held responsible for it, he knew without asking any justification he would be killed mercilessly.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">There was no scope of running. Behind him was the dark empty cave and running troop of wild humans everywhere else. He thought about running but they were too close. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">One of them was ahead, he saw him pausing his run and clipping up the rock. Painting himself in black, even in the snow he only had limited tree bark on him. His eyes showed true rage. It seemed as if he was not a human but an animal. Looking at him anyone would say that he was not going to show any form of mercy.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Others followed him, Ved saw them coming towards him. There was no escape. He sensed it, It was creepier than anything he had feared in his life yet. Just when he had his moment of joy, he was going to face it. In that cold windy weather, he knew his fate was sealed.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;This is death&rsquo; he thought and closed his eyes.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p style="font-size:1.3rem"># # # # #</p>
            </div>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Disha noticed his cold eyes. Chills went through him even while he was speaking. She couldn&rsquo;t believe him, but he looked serious. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Not expressing her disbelief but a little disagreement, she asked &lsquo;Ved you are alive you see. Please calm down&rsquo; She held his hand to comfort him. His hand was still shivering.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;How did you escape it?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He looked at her with confusion. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo; he exclaimed.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He held her hand tightly and suddenly went unstable. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what happened. I didn&rsquo;t do anything&rsquo;</p>

            <div style="text-align: center;margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <p style="font-size:1.3rem"># # # # #</p>
            </div>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Snow droplets were hitting him slightly. Closer to the dawn, with his eyes closed, he knew he was gonna die. Ved could hear their rush and blood lust. It was too loud. And getting louder. He could hear the birds, wolf howls and other animals. He could hear his heartbeat. It was louder. He freed his hand from burden of the torch.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;This is it&rsquo; he thought.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">But suddenly, the other noises went on decreasing. It decreased till an extent that there was pin drop silence. Neither the tribal wildlings, neither the animals, or birds nor the breeze, he could hear nothing. The sound of cold winds disappeared as well and hence the snow. To contradict, there was warmth. He felt comfortable. It was relaxing and all he could sense was silent darkness.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;What happened? Is this death?&rsquo; he thought.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He slowly opened his eyes. It was blurry. His forged eyes barely agreed to open. It was dim. The mild soothing lights were familiar, he had seen them somewhere. He sensed feeling of homeliness.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He focused further to see a ceiling. Seeing the dim orange lights around, he soon realised that he was in his hotel room. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He widened his eyes. &lsquo;Was it just a dream?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">It seemed very real. The fear was real. He cleaned his forehead sweat. He noticed a dense environment though, something was not right. He focused his eyes on the ceiling, and saw blood spots. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">His nose suddenly noticed a sickening, pungent and stinking smell. He got up unbearingly and coughed. Just when he was feeling relieved, dreadful pain stuck his mind again on what he saw.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;AAAAAhhh&rsquo; He screamed. Every cell in his body was horrified.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Chills went through him as he saw Steve, Hussain, and Peter lying down besides his bed. They had ruthlessly been murdered. They were headless, lying in blood. Blood was spilled everywhere on walls and throughout the room.Their heads were mercilessly thrown besides them. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">They were not only beheaded, but it seemed like someone pulled their heads of their spine. He went thoughtless for sometime. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">It was shocking. Ved didn&rsquo;t knew what to do. Just when he was feeling relieved from the fearful dream, he was unknowingly facing another terror. He screamed again.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">With fear he slided back towards the wall on the bed, without landing down. The room itself smelled dead. Looking at the speechless room. He questioned himself. &lsquo;What the hell just happened?&rsquo; </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He turned to his left and was shocked. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">His senses went dumb as he saw an old gold titled book with a warm shine. Besides the bed, it was placed carefully on the table. It seemed to have no problem with things going on as it is. With words carved on it in ancient sanskrit.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Granth Vyas&rsquo; it read</p>
