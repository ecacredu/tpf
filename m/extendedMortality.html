        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You knew I was going to come?’ Yug asked Ved. He seemed to be amazed.</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes. I assumed you knew it? Were you not the one in my dreams?’ Ved asked panicking.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Come again?’ Yug seemed confused.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘It was around a week before when I got this manuscript. Since then, I have heard voices in my head while sleeping,
            saying <i>I am coming</i>’ Ved said. ‘I thought it was you.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I have no role to play there.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘In that case, I already knew someone was going to come’ With cold eyes, Ved explained to him that he could not decide
            if the one coming would be with or against him. In fear, he was so afraid that he did not open the door for anyone
            until he heard Disha’s voice that day earlier.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Maybe the manuscript pre-informed you of my arrival. I am myself not aware of its whole power.' Yug said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But you are the one to whom it belongs right? You should know what happened.’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes, it is true. But it has been passed to me by my clan. I had to protect it as long as I could. And keep it away
            from any human contact.’ Yug told Ved that he had been protecting that manuscript since five centuries, but ultimately,
            Ved got his hands on the book by fate.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Oh Great one, Mind if I ask you a question?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">To Yug’s nod, Ved asked. ‘You said you are alive for beyond five centuries. Doesn’t that mean you are immortal too?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No people of my clan have an average lifespan of two thousand years. But we perish eventually. So we are mortal.’
            Yug cleared.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But how?’ Ved asked. He was astounded.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘An average lifespan of more than a millennium? The whole clan lives that long?’ Ved wondered.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Is it even possible? What sorcery is it? Does magic really exist?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What is magic according to you?’ Yug asked calmly.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved stayed silent. Yug continued. ‘Magic is what human science doesn’t understand. Or a part of science yet to be
            discovered.’ Yug continued further. ‘Simply put in your terms, It is a higher level understanding and hence the
            application, of science.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved recalled Yug keeping his hand over the book and hence the corresponding explanation he gave. ‘What science was
            it to touch the book and view the past?’ he asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Confused in chaos with a constant question<i> why me?</i> Ved continued. ‘Also, Where do I fit in this higher level
            of science? I got the <i>Granth</i> accidentally, and so simply, without any struggle. I feel I don’t even deserve
            it. Back when you said I took a perfect decision? Would your chosen one run away from a situation, like I did?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘When I placed my hand on the manuscript and focused, what I scientifically did was to gather the traces of memories
            it preserved and envision it.’ Yug explained.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As he saw Ved sincerely listening to him, Yug continued further. ’Every knowledge that you seek roams around the
            universe around you and is interlinked. You just need to focus to perceive it.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was shocked. Though seemed impossible, What Yug said did make sense. If knowledge were going to limit on what
            one knows, No discovery hence advancement in science would have taken place. Gathering memory traces seemed practically
            impossible, but if Yug claimed to do it and gave him actual demo for the same, ‘Maybe it is possible’ he thought.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">However, Even if it were true, Ved, an ordinary individual, did not understand where he fit in the extraordinary
            lesser known world Yug was talking about. ‘But how does that justify me being the chosen one?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You have that power too!’ Yug continued.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was shocked. ‘What?’ he asked.</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Everyone has. Everyone uses it at some or the other point of time without realization.’ Yug replied. ‘If I can collect
            memories attached to an external physical object, Do you think subconsciously you were not aware of the whole
            vision you saw?’ Yug asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You mean…’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes. You had seen the entire day of yours too.’ Yug continued. ‘You are not amongst the one who would run away even
            from the worst situation.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was surprised on that comment. Hearing his praise from such a great person, he chose to remain silent.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You stand by right. You will go against all the odds and face them, for truth, even if it means death.’ Yug exclaimed.
            ‘As I said before, You got the manuscript because it was bound to happen.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was not entirely convinced. Everything was difficult for him to digest. He had initially preassumed the sage
            to be Maharishi Ved Vyas, the author of Mahabharata, hence committed him to go with him. But soon he got to know
            that it was Yug and not him, who claimed to be his follower.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Then the sage claimed to have lived a longer than usual life. Finally, he claimed the whole of his clan to be like
            him. Ved carried doubt on his decision now. His thoughts resisted not believing Yug for some reason suddenly.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Is he telling the truth or playing with my mind taking advantage of my psychiatric trauma?’ Ved thought, looking
            at the physically fit brahmin who looked barely in his forties.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Though deep in his heart, Ved wanted an affirmative answer to his question. He had not told anyone yet, about actual
            reasons for planning the trip to Uttarakhand, where it all happened. The reason for which he was so desperate
            for the expedition, Desperate enough to walk out alone in those dense forests that night, even at the cost of
            his life.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He looked at his vibrating cell phone. It displayed five missed calls and two new messages. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">It was high time to decide. If Ved took a decision to go and would tell the same to Disha, she would definitely oppose
            his idea to leave without informing the place he was heading to. ‘Though I even don’t know where we will be going.’
            Ved thought.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He yet again decided to ignore his mobile. Disha was trying to call him for three hours. Naturally, she cared about
            him. But he still felt the conversation with the sage was more important than anything in the world. He hoped
            to get answers he had been searching for his entire childhood.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">But some questions needed to be answered right away. ‘Oh sage, Where will we be going?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘We will be going to a place called Vrukshavrundavan.' It is where my clan resides.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Will I get an answer to all my questions there?’ Ved asked in doubt.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes probably.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved knew it would be offensive, but if it were a situation of life or death, it didn’t matter. ‘Oh brahmin, Why are
            we not sure of me getting the answers?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Because some things are beyond our knowledge as well.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But at least the one who predicted that <i>the first human who gets his hands on the manuscript would be the one, </i>should
            know the purpose of the one right?’ Ved asked confusingly.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes. He should. But it is not the head of my clan who predicted that.’ Yug clarified.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Then?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘It is Maharishi Ved Vyas’ Yug replied.</p>
