        <p class="pageHeading para">‘It was a possible future?’ Ved was thoughtless.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes.’ Yug Replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved had no clue what Yug was saying. Everything went over his head. Though things were hard to believe, what he had
            faced and seen was real. With Yug giving him an explanation, Ved had no alternative option but to accept what
            he was saying. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">However, he couldn’t bear the thought that his friends could go against him, and even try to kill him. Furthermore,
            even if Peter and Hussain would force, Ved thought, Steve will never stand for something like that. He was not
            only his subordinate but a close friend as well.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He had chosen to listen to him earlier, as he says, but he resisted ‘Steve is like my brother. Others are good friends
            as well. I don’t think they can even think of doing something like this.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘It might be hard for you to believe, but everyone wears a mask on his face. Each and every individual ultimately
            lives for himself Ved. You shall realize this soon as we progress ahead, nobody is pure hearted. As said in <i>Puranas</i>,
            in this era, everyone will ultimately perish thinking for themselves.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was thoughtless for a moment and had no argument to frame. ‘Even if humans are unpredictable and they lose their
            mind in greed. To such an unimaginable extent?’ he thought to himself.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Can we trust anyone?’ Ved asked sarcastically.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Let me help you with your thoughts, To be honest, I can’t say for sure, but I don’t think their inner selfishness
            or greed would have been the only factor that could be held responsible.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved looked confused and waited for Yug to continue.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘As I was telling you. The Manuscript, it has spiritual binding across it. There are things beyond what you know.
            Even in the twenty-first century, On this material side of the world, humans are yet to unleash their real potential.’
            Yug replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved looked at the book. ‘It generated greed in them?’ He asked himself looking at it. If it were true, his mind couldn’t
            decide if the book was good or evil. He chose to ask the same. ‘So, Is this script cursed?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘It is. For the ones who wish to use it for their selfish motives.’ Yug calmly replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was quick and asked in doubt. ‘Then why did you not let the one’s following you take it? It would have murdered
            them as well.’</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug was silent. ‘In my vision, it was not the <i>Granth </i>that killed them.’ Yug continued. ‘I do not know the
            reason for the same. I saw only darkness and could hear terror. I could not see what murdered them<i>.'</i> Even
            Yug looked terrified as he remembered the roars. Yug skipped the topic and said. ‘Also, In this universe, there
            are forces with a lot more strength than you can imagine. If something is sealed and bound, the seal can be broken
            as well. To express in your language, They have similar <i>mantras</i> to decode it. Don’t underestimate their
            power.’
        </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Oh Brahmin, but you seem very mighty, A simple jump of yours as you said, made a dent on a mountain.’ Ved said.
            ‘Can someone be stronger than you that you have to run from them?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I was chased by a group, not an individual. Even if I am powerful, I couldn’t have sustained them all. And, it was
            not about me and my life. God forbid if they had got their hands on the <i>Granth, </i>the world would have turned
            upside down in even a week till now.<i>’</i></p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But who are they?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You will get to know everything. Just wait for the right time.’ Yug said. ‘However, I am glad they did not get their
            hands on the manuscript.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was overwhelmed, hearing the power of the book and feared at the same time. ‘But how did I end up getting the
            <i>Granth</i>? You said the temple was not perceivable by eyes of even those mighty people following you. But
            I saw it, and that was where I got it. Why me?’</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I have no answer to that. You have to come with me and find it out by yourself.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Who will be answering my questions? Whom are we going to? Are we going to Ved Vyas?’ Ved asked desperately because
            he simply needed answers and wanted to find out if immortality actually existed.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘As I have told you. Maharishi Vyas is not that simple to meet. We will be going to the head of my clan. He will
            probably answer all your questions.’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug said <i>probably</i> while speaking and Ved noticed it. He understood that even Yug was unsure of some things.
            He did not want to stretch on the topic and push embarrassment on him. But his mind was disturbed. It did not
            seem to him that Yug was lying, but it was simply not possible for Ved to digest everything.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘So, What I saw was future?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘A possible future.’ Yug reanswered.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved tried to, but he couldn’t understand it. ‘But is it possible?’ He thought.</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Can anyone, do it? Can anyone actually change the future?’ Ved asked reluctantly. ‘If I see future, I see it because
            it’s going to happen. But then it doesn’t happen. Meaning what I saw was not future?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Hearing the paradox from Ved, Yug giggled a bit and said. ‘But what if these sequences of events were meant to happen?
            What you saw was not future, but a possibility, like a warning.’ </p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Oh <i>Brahmin</i>, I see no answer to my question there? Can anyone change the future?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes. People say your future is in your hand. They do mean it. You shape what you become. The way you think, and
            act determines the future.’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But if it goes by how you say, Then I changed future of 4 people including myself? My friends are not dead.’ Ved
            asked remembering his friends.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No, you changed the future of the whole world.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Looking at Ved’s dazzled face, Yug continued ‘Each and every one of us, is linked. Every individual’s actions trigger
            actions of others in the world and vice versa.’ He smiled as he said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved understood what Yug’s point. He again chose to be silent. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug decided to break the silence. ‘Do you mind giving me a glass of water?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes sure.’ Ved rushed to the kitchen to get the same. Looking at the clean kitchen, he felt nostalgic. ‘Disha’ he
            remembered. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He took out his cell phone kept on silent mode to see two missed calls and a message from her asking him to call
            back. He thought of calling her, but that would rather be time-consuming he thought. He texted her back. ‘Will
            call you back in some time Disha. Sorry to keep you waiting…’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Ved?’ Yug called him, Ved rushed back to his room and handed him the glass.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug meanwhile looked around Ved’s things. He looked at all the material, the messy papers, his files and the old
            reference books. ‘These are your grandfather’s?’ asked Yug holding an old book in his hand.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved nodded.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘He was an archaeologist too?’ Yug asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes. The best. And I wish to become like him.’ Ved replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes, he was. The very fact that he knew the verse shows his intensive research.’ Yug said remembering the verse
            Ved said his grandfather had told him. ‘The temple is very sacred, and its location is not mentioned anywhere.
            I wonder where he got to hear that. He had a pretty strong network I assume.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved felt proud. He genuinely admired his grandfather. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug looked at the big messy graph on the wall drawn by Ved while researching on the <i>Granth</i>. ‘You are pretty
            intelligent. You found out a pretty good chunk of information with such limited resources.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug gazed at Ved while analyzing the threads and their endpoints. ‘No wonder you were chosen.’ Yug smiled.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But how do you know I am the one?’ Ved was persistent. He wanted answers. With a mere <i>I will come with you</i>,
            Ved had put a pause to his ten years of professional career for something he did not have any clue about. At
            first, he had assumed the <i>brahmin</i> to be Ved Vyas, but he was disappointed later.</p>
        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Because the first human who would get this manuscript was going to be the one.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What does that mean? Even if you had placed it anywhere, any human would have taken it.’ Ved expressed his query.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No, it’s not that simple. There are lots of clauses to that as well. Also, you are capable as well. You are intelligent
            and fearless too.’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved could understand Yug calling him intelligent as a compliment after viewing his research work, but he did not
            understand the other part. ‘Fearless?’ he asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug replied. ‘For an ordinary individual, someone mysteriously standing on the ninth floor on his balcony would have
            been a havoc. But, you reacted quite calmly. You are indeed fearless.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Yug went speechless, and a pin drop silence spread across the room as he heard what Ved said. ‘Because… I knew you
            would come.’ Ved continued. ‘I was waiting for you.’</p>
