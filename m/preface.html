              <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Knock knock!!&rsquo; shouted the door. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">The glass in his hand slipped, breaking down and spilling water all across the floor. Trying to stay as calm as possible, he was stunned as he saw everything going out of his hands. May be they have found him he thought.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was too afraid to open it. He just peeked at door from inside. With curtains closed, he had kept the lights off for nobody to notice him. Like his dense dark candle lit study room, he chose to remain silent. The situation was tense enough for him to think that the whole world was after him.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">This time the door knocked vigorously, like the bumps of fist bawled. Someone was trying to force himself in, while the door stood between Ved and him.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Thud thud!!&rsquo; </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;I know you are inside, Open the door or i&rsquo;ll break it.&rsquo; said a soft familiar voice.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">That voice!</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He couldn&rsquo;t believe his ears. It was really her. With his mixed feelings of comfort and fear, he slowly came out in hall, thinking weather to respond or play away silently.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Please open it Ved. I know you are there.&rsquo; as her voice begged in helplessness, she sat down on her knees crying.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He was shocked. Every possible thought crashed in his mind, but his heart still resisted in favour to break silence, so finally he whispered &lsquo;Disha!&rsquo; he paused. &lsquo;How did you get to know that I am here?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Without waiting for her to reply, he continued in his strained voice. &lsquo;Anyways it doesn&rsquo;t matter, Please go away. And don't tell anyone that I am here, please leave me alone.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She felt relieved. For her, it was like ages since she had heard his voice.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;No way, I won&rsquo;t. It has already been a week now Ved since you went missing. I am so glad I found you.&rsquo; She gasped and continued.&rsquo; What are you doing here? Please open the door, Let&rsquo;s go home.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Just gooo!&rsquo; as he talked, Disha noticed his depressed mental state.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Obviously Not&rsquo; she said persistently. &lsquo;Open the door or i&rsquo;ll just be sitting here&rsquo;.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">After a long silence, he finally opened the door.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Her moist eyes explained it all. It was nearly after a month that she was meeting him. She felt blessed and hugged him tightly.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She looked around. All the mess presented his condition from past whole week. He had mostly locked himself in the room and went outside for limited reasons. Considering his fame, he was very social but obviously was behaving strange now.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She looked at him. Noticing his nervousness, it was obvious. Something was not right.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She asked caringly. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong Ved? Why are you doing this to me? Please tell me.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Looking at his tired and sleepless eyes, she gulped &rsquo;I promise I will help you solve it. Please, I beg you.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para"> It brought him to grief. He noticed her heart piercing concern. It was not her fault at all. Everyone was searching for him. She was too.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He caressed her hair with his fingers and looked upon her eyes. Wiping her tears, he said. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t hide it anymore from you. I will tell you everything.Come with me.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He held her hand caringly. She felt comfortable. They walked towards his research room. Everything seemed messy and disturbed. They walked in front of the cupboard. Signalling her to wait and watch, he opened it&rsquo;s door. Digging inside the stack of his clothes, he took out a big diagonal container out of it. It was packed with a red velvet cloth.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He placed it carefully on his bed besides. &lsquo;Before I open this, I will tell you everything. But keep it only to yourself?&rsquo; He asked reassuringly.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">The creepy atmosphere was already very intense. Ignoring the suspense, &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; She noded. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">She was curious to know what was buried in his mind for past few days and why he was so over-protective about each and everything that he does and feared each and every person that he met. It was as if, he was afraid of the whole world.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was a well known Archaeologist. He had won numerous awards and his contribution towards the society was priceless. For the first time, Disha was seeing him so helpless and disturbed.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">This all started since his last expedition. With hesitation, he started telling on what happened with him on his trip to Uttarakhand a month ago.</p>
