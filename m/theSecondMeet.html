        <h1 class="pageHeading">The Second Meet</h1>
        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was stunned as he saw the mysterious figure slowly walking towards him. His calm voice claiming that the book
            belonged to him still echoed in Ved’s mind. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He couldn’t believe his eyes. The <i>Brahmin</i> looked simple, but his presence spilled power everywhere. Ved could
            feel the exceptional aura surrounding him. His dark green eyes did not let Ved look at them directly. His dressing
            was subtle but comfortable.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Being a literature expert, Ved knew 19 languages. But he couldn’t gather words in any of them, to say to him.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Everything did exist. It was never a myth.’ Ved thought thinking about Mahabharata. With sheer respect, he bent
            down and touched the sage’s feet. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Vijayi Bhava.' The Sage raised his palm and blessed him for success.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Keeping all his worries and depression aside, and gathering some courage to speak, joining his hands, asked in a
            mild tone. ‘Hey Great One, What is it that you seek?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I wish for you to come with me. You have a purpose to serve.’ The sage replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">With no hesitation, ‘I shall do whatever you say. I will come with you.’ Ved responded in an instant, but he had
            a lot of unanswered questions which he seeked answers for.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You look confused. What is troubling you?’ asked the Brahmin.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘The situation.’ Ved said.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I would be pleased to hear what you have to say.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved then told him the entire story, right from the beginning of his expedition to getting the Scripture. Then seeing
            his death, the death of his subordinates, and then them getting back to life. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved told him every part of what happened. However, the Sage seemed to emphasize on a particular part.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You saw the Shiva Temple?’ The sage asked his part of the question and continued. ’That is strange. It can't be
            seen by everyone. Also, how does your grandfather know about the Verse?’ He asked about the verse, which conveys
            description, about the Massive Shiva Temple which Ved saw.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘I don’t know. I was in my mid age when grandfather lost his life. Never got a chance to ask such stuff at that time.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What was your grandfather’s name? Also, state me your name.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Bhaskar Trivedi, That’s my grandfather's name.’ As he spoke, his words reflected respect for his grandfather. ‘And,
            my name is Ved.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Ved Trivedi it is.’ The great sage said addressing him. ‘What question do you have in your mind?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘TRRRINGG TRRRINGG … TRRRINGG TRRRINGG’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">The interaction was broken all of sudden by the cell phone ring. It was Disha. He looked at the time. It was nine
            already. He had to leave, but some things are more important he thought and canceled the call. </p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">He sent her a text message. ‘Disha, at a critical part of the research. Ttyl.’ He put the phone on silent and kept
            it aside.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Extremely Sorry for the noise.’ Ved continued. ‘Everything is changed in my life since I got this book. I was about
            to die. I was prepared to die. I closed my eyes for so. But I magically came back to our hotel room and saw the
            dreadful view.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Who saved me? Why is all this happening to me?’ Ved pleaded seeking answers.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘The manuscript did.’ The <i>Brahmin</i> said pointing at it.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was even more confused now. He said, ‘Huh? How can a book save me?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘It is not a usual book. The manuscript has spiritual bindings on it.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved had no shred of the doubt in what he said. It was complicated for him to think and he just chose to believe what
            he heard. Everything he had experienced came back to him. Also remembering an important part of this conversation,
            he asked. ‘Oh Great Sage, Can I ask you another question that bothers me?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">As the Sage nodded affirmatively, Ved continued ‘You said I have to go with you and that I have some purpose to serve.
            What is it?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Some things are meant to be let for time to uncover. You will get to know soon.’ He replied.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But why me? I got the book accidently.’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘There is no such thing as an accident. The manuscript chose you. The fact that you saw the Shiva sculpture and the
            temple are in itself a huge thing. Though being so obvious, The marvelous sculpture can't be perceived by the
            eyes of an ordinary individual.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘The manuscript chose me?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes. Or else you would not have got it in the first place. It was a matter of few minutes in which the book was
            collected by you, and your traces disappeared from near the temple, and I lost it.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘What do you mean by that, oh great sage?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘The fact is that I was there in the forest at that time, being chased by someone for this manuscript. I could have
            been killed, and the script would have been taken, but I reached the temple safely. And as I said, the temple
            is not perceptible to others. They lost the sight of me and so the book, which I then placed there to keep it
            safe for the time being and recollect later. But when I came back, the book was missing.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘You kept the book there? Do you mean… ’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Yes. The jolting sound you heard was me when I landed on the mountain. And someone running behind you might have
            been the one’s chasing me.’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">Ved got the clarified that the sound was made by him, landing on the mountain. But while admiring, the sheer power
            of the Brahmin, Ved had an epiphany. ‘But… You were being chased? Who on earth can dare to do that? And how can
            you be killed Oh Great One? You are immortal, aren’t you?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘No?’</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘But as per ancient scripts, Ved Vyas, is supposedly immortal.'</p>

        <p class="pageHeading para">‘Of course, he is. I wish to collect the other part of the manuscript to meet him. And to clear your possible confusion,’
            The <i>Brahmin</i> continued. ’ I am not Maharishi Ved Vyas, but his follower. My Name is Yug.’</p>
