              <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Come fast Ved.&rsquo; called his colleague.</p>
            <p class="pageHeading para">Their clothes were all dusty. Everyone was tired of seeing those heavy rigid rocks and hence the expedition. Ved being the team leader, felt nervous as he felt the responsibility for the whole trip and hence its results, which were not upto the mark. They were all here for the sake of curiosity, expecting something from the old ruins of ancient indian culture. But after 15 days of collective work, they were empty handed.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved and his reforms were well known and he was renowned archaeologist of all times. He had won countless awards. This expedition was supposed to be best of his expectations. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">They had already called the day off. But considering his persistent nature, he was still inside giving a last glance at everything to see if they missed anything.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Yes Steve. Coming.&rsquo; He said sadly, while coming out of the cave. &lsquo;I guess we have to go back empty handed this time.&rsquo; He said to his trio subordinates. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">They came back to hotel. &lsquo;Hello sir&rsquo; greeted the manager. Ved waved at him and sighed his disappointment. Ved being the lead had coordinated with him frequently. After staying there for half a month now, they had got pretty casual with each other. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">They came back to their respective rooms. Ved switched on the lights and indicated Steve to put on the heater.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved felt restless though.&lsquo;I think we should give it a last try Steve.&rsquo; Ved said to his room mate.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Bro? It&rsquo;s ok. We have been doing this last try thing for two days now. It's too late.&rsquo; His voice echoed through the washroom. After a long pause, he said pretending to convince.&rsquo; Also, we have been advised not to leave our rooms at night. As per reports, it can start snowing any moment now.&rsquo; Steve replied from the bathroom while getting fresh. After a long silence. He continued in his gruffy voice. &lsquo;We need to get ready. We have our flight back tomorrow morning if you remember.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved knew he was right and didn&rsquo;t want to force him. But it was he who held the responsibility of the trip and hence was eager. He made up his mind. He searched for his torch in the dim lit room, and packed it. &lsquo;You are coming or should I go alone?&rsquo; He asked conformingly.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;No way bro. I am not. You do as you wish.&rsquo; He said thinking it was a joke.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para"> &lsquo;OK. I am leaving.&rsquo; He started walking towards the door without turning around.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Steve was still inside &lsquo;You are kidding right? Let&rsquo;s get ready and go for dinner. Hussain and Peter might be hungry as well.&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para"> &lsquo;Ved?&rsquo; </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Thud&rsquo; shut the door.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved left his room. And soon he left the city lights too, entering in dark peaky mountains. His wristwatch showed 10PM. He took compass in his hand, seeing for directions from where they started on their first day. In the dark night, all he had for his company was his backpack, camera and a torch.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Coming back to tunnel&rsquo;s place from where they started their research. He searched everywhere and everything he could. The chilling cold winds were by passing his wind-cheater. But he pulled down his sweater </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;If I think in same wrong direction, How can I get a different result?&rsquo; he thought, after doing the same thing for a while.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He decided to take a walk in forest and find related traces. He being a traveller and adventurous, was aware of the dangers but his conscience instructed him to do so. He started walking towards the forest. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Entering the dark dense forest further, he walked for straight 3 hours in search of any possible archaeological evidence. Following negative output yet again, he finally decided to quit. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Just about he was to retreat when he heard a jingling sound. It came from far somewhere. He followed the sound. Seeing the silhouettes, It was definitely some human walking in the dark. Finding it odd, he chose to follow his shadow.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;What might he be up to?&rsquo; Ved asked himself.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He got a closer look and found that the tall figure to be a male tribal. The man looked stoned as he walked. Stopping near a standing stone, Ved observed him lighting a small lamp near it.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">As Ved peeked from the trees, he saw him bowing in moon&rsquo;s direction and joining his hands to pray. The tribal stood there for a while and then suddenly turned around and gazed at Ved. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">His heart skipped a beat; But then Aghori gave a heavenly smile and turned back towards the jungle. For some reason, Ved felt comforting. But he was shocked. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Har har mahadev&rsquo; he cheered, praising Neelkanth&rsquo;s glory, he started walking.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">As he walked, Ved was stunned. &lsquo;What just happened?&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;He knew all the time that I was here?&rsquo;</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Seeing his vanishing figure in jungle, Ved decided to stay still and let it go.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Foot holding himself, Ved then walked towards the lamp seeing for whom and what was he praying. Just when he looked at moon, his eyes rolled out in excitement.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;OH MY! How on earth can we miss such a thing?&rsquo; he exclaimed.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">The view was just breathtaking. Call that another marvelous creation of god. Amidst the huge mountain partially blocking the moon, he saw a godly face carved on it. It seemed like Lord Shiva himself was sitting and meditating under a huge waterfall. He went speechless. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was well aware of the indian culture and hence various indian vedic scripts. He suddenly remembered his grandfather&rsquo;s words clearly.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Carved by thousands, he who holds the heavenly river in his jatas will bring forth the one who will decide it all. For the one who sees it, will have no choice left but to flow towards it. It will decide for him, what he will be. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He couldn&rsquo;t believe he was really seeing it. In that huge sculpture, resided a hidden temple. With his eyes, he admired the monument of legends, which showed the mysteries of unknown. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Without wasting any moment, he started walking and eventually running towards it. The fear of it, being a dream and vanishing around, tortured his mind. He couldn&rsquo;t stop himself.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He was really flowing towards it. His legs were moving on its own. It drove him so crazy that he forgot about everything and all that he wanted was to go towards it.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">This was when he felt something running behind him towards the deeper jungle. His reflexes were sharp. He got alert. Carefully, he looked behind but found no one.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He sensed an unusual pressure in atmosphere. It was definitely someone or something. Just when he was trying to analyze the situation when he heard an ear-splitting sound from the other side.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Throooooooooooff!!&rsquo; The sound was as loud as a meteor crashing from sky.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para"> As the thing stuck on ground, the vibrations stumbled him knocking down on the floor. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">With a lot of fear and anxiety, struggling with darkness, adding the irregular rocky and snowy ground, he jumped around and ran as quickly as possible towards the mysterious sculpture and hence the origin of the sound. He felt a sudden rise in temperature as he approached the source.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Finally reached there to find a huge dent in a mountain. The dent was fresh but deep. By applying any human scientific logic, it was not possible. He searched for any crashing stones or other elements nearby but couldn&rsquo;t find any. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">After roaming around for awhile, he decided to go to the temple above, with expectation to find something there. He gazed at the marvelous sculpture again. He started trekking upwards, towards the temple. The condition of the monument was devastatingly ruined. It seemed so old that even the mountains had taken the sculpture in its arm.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">The reason of the sound was still unknown, but it had made its impact throughout the forest. Ved was not alone to hear it. Tribals obviously had noticed it too. &lsquo;Bluhh bluhh bluhh&rsquo; They made recursive howling noise from multiple directions.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved was probably the first human to reach there. He suddenly heard a lot of people approaching towards him (cave).</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Situation further tightened when he heard animal howls and roars. All the birds and animals in the forest showed their discomfort making peculiar sounds. Without further thoughts, deciding to follow his instinct, he jumped inside the temple.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Unlike the opening, It was huge inside. His torch showed him nothing but a straight dark walkable path which seemed to have no end. He preferred to run though. Contradicting to noisy animal howls outside, it was chilling calm inside. He was already panting. The still dead air inside was making him suffocate. But then, He noticed a sharp reflection through his torch. Confused with hope he ran faster.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">Ved finally reached there and was stunned to see that the light was nothing but his torch reflecting its light from a gold plated book half buried in the wall. It was loose, as if just put in there. </p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">The walls beside depicted mythological carvings. But, without wasting any time, he kept his torch in convenient angle, he started pulling it.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">After few minutes of struggle, with his muddy hands, he finally tried to pull it out. The book was huge. It weighed more than couple of kgs. He dusted and tried to clean the book covered in soil. Cleaned it enough to see its title in ancient sanskrit.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Granth Vyas&rsquo; he read.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He was utterless. He had no other thoughts. In that dark stillness, He opened the huge book. Its pages were made up of pure thick tree bark. They seemed to be perfectly engineered so as to survive for ages. The quality of ink and handwritten words itself seemed like a miracle.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">He was glad he won&rsquo;t be going home empty handed. He was happy. &lsquo;Sometimes all it requires is dedicated and honest effort&rsquo; he thought. There are a lot of times when we strive for something and quit. But we try harder further and get extra ordinary results.</p>

            <p class="pageHeading para">&lsquo;Mahabharata!&rsquo; He cheered loudly. &lsquo;I have found The Mahabharata. </p>
