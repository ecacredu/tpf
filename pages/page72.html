        <p>Even after his text messages, she was persistently calling him. Though her calls and messages were disturbing the
            conversation. ‘She must be worrying’ Ved thought.</p>

        <p>Though he hadn't made up his strangling mind for going with Yug completely and was not up to a decision, he finally
            picked up her call. ‘Hello.’</p>

        <p>‘Ved!’ Disha Yelled. Her voice felt afraid yet silent. ‘I tried to call you so many times.’</p>

        <p>‘What happened Disha?’ Ved asked on his cell phone. ‘I had messaged you that I will give you a callback.’</p>

        <p>She suddenly went silent and slowly said. ‘Listen carefully Ved. And do not ask further questions.’</p>

        <p>Ved was surprised for the sudden tone change. He was keen to hear what she would say. ‘Yes. I am listening.’</p>

        <p>Ved’s eyes widened as he heard what Disha said.’Has Yug reached there?’</p>

        <p>Ved was shocked. ‘What? But how do you even…’</p>

        <p>‘Stay silent and don’t let him notice I am telling this. Just listen.’ Disha said. ‘Do not trust him. He is a con
            man and don’t believe a word of what he says.’</p>
        <p>‘But Disha… ’ Call disconnected before Ved could complete his sentence. Ved felt a deep shock at that very moment.
            He was speechless for few seconds.</p>
