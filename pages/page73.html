        <p>Ved looked at Yug and pretended to continue talking. ‘But Disha, I am busy right now. Can't come at this moment.’
            He paused a bit. ‘Ok, Do as you want!’ He pretended to disconnect the call from his end.</p>

        <p>‘Who is Disha?’ Yug asked.</p>

        <p>Ved was shocked and was still not out of what he heard on his phone. ‘How the hell does Disha even know about Yug?’
            Ved asked to himself. ‘And how does she judge that he is a con-man?’ He thought while looking at Yug.</p>

        <p>But Ved had to reply to his question. ‘She is a friend… Was asking me out for dinner…’ he mumbled as he spoke.</p>

        <p>Yug now looked at Ved suspiciously. ‘Oh yes… You have missed your dinner time.’ Yug said changing the topic. </p>

        <p>Ved wanted to make things look normal. ‘Oh Nevermind… Where were we?’</p>

        <p>‘I had told you that I hear voices of Maharishi Ved Vyas inside me and that I am instructed to take you to our village,
            Vrukshavrundavan’ Yug answered.</p>

        <p>As Yug was speaking, Ved seemed to come back to reality again. Yug had said that he didn’t meet Vyas even once. Yug
            seemed convicted, but it also meant that <i>Maharishi</i> <i>Vyas</i> could just not exist. Was Mahabharata even
            real? Or was it just a story? If it was real is the author of Mahabharata, Maharishi Vyas still alive? Ved’s
            couldn’t just grab hold of his thoughts.</p>
