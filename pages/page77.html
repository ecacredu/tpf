        <p>‘You went ahead. You could have just got rid of it. But you reversed the car, came back and took it back!’ Yug said.</p>
        <p>‘Yes, I did.’ Ved said. ‘How does it matter over here?’</p>

        <p>‘You took it back not because it was a precious research material.’ Yug continued. ‘But because you did not want
            anyone else to suffer like what had you went through.’</p>

        <p>Ved’s eyes widened. He had not told a part of it to Yug, but he knew everything. ‘Was I seriously being followed
            right from the start?’ Ved thought. ‘But he could have found me sooner, in that case, there was no reason to
            wait for such long to approach me. Also if it were just the book, he would have just taken it and vanished.’
            Ved wondered. But not only about his actions, but Yug had also told him about how and what he felt while taking
            the manuscript back.</p>

        <p>‘You do not understand yourself. Please have faith in me and come along.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p>Ved looked at his cell phone. ‘Do not believe a single word of he says’ was said by Disha. Firstly, Disha had no
            reason to even know about Yug. Furthermore, she instructed Ved prominently to do something. This was the first
            time she had done something like this. She surely was strange. </p>

        <p>But there was also another explanation to it. ‘Maybe everything is just an illusion. Yug himself… Disha’s call. Maybe
            I seriously need psychiatric attention.’ Ved thought.</p>
