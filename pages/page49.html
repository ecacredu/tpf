   <p>As he saw dead bodies of his former subordinates, Ved felt paralyzed. It was not just a murder. Their heads were brutally pulled off their spine. By applying any logic, It cannot be an act of a human. </p>

<p>‘Should I stay or run away?’ he thought.</p>

<p>Amongst that stingy smell of dead bodies, he sat there for half an hour. Numb and Paralysed. He wasn’t able to grab hold of the situation. ‘What can be done at this stage?’ he thought</p>

<p>‘Maybe I should call the police.’ Considering his situation, he was a very well-known archaeologist. He had enough political and legal support to save him in court. ‘Nobody can sack me for an inhuman act, that I haven’t even done.’ Ved thought.</p>

<p>He called his lawyer and told him everything. The lawyer instructed him to call the police and tell them everything as it is and that he is leaving the US for India and will take care of everything once he arrives.</p>

<p>Ved was about to do the same. But first, he thought to collect others witnesses to see it as well. He wanted to make them sure of what has happened. He left the bloodshed room as it is and started walking to the reception. As he left, everyone was looking at him as if they already know he’s the suspect.</p>
