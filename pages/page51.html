    <p>‘Did someone just clean the suite?’ Ved said as he saw a blurry vision in front of him. ‘I didn’t do anything’ he mumbled and felt unconscious.</p>
    <p>……… … ...</p>
    <p>‘Ved! Ved get up bro!’ said a familiar voice. ‘What have you done to yourself?’ Ved heard as he came back to consciousness.</p>

<p>He was on his bed, surrounded by the manager, his subordinates and a person with a stethoscope hanging around his neck.</p>

<p>‘He hasn’t eaten since yesterday. Also, dehydrated. It is certain; he will be weak.’ Said the doctor.</p>

<p>‘We will take care of him, Doctor.’ Steve said. ‘We had our flight back today to the US, but guess we’ve missed it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, he will be okay now.’ Said the doctor. He then talked with others a bit, gave necessary instructions and got out of the room.</p>

<p>After some time, Ved got up and got hold of the situation. ‘It was just an illusion’ he declared to himself. They are live and alive.</p>

<p>‘Hey… You should rest! And next time you are not going anywhere alone.’ Said his roommate, rushing back to him quickly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I won't.’ He said remembering his death scene.</p>
