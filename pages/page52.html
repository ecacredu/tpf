<p>After taking some rest, he got fresh and said to Steve. ‘I have something to show to you guys. Call everyone Steve’</p>

<p>Steve followed his team leader's orders and did the same. The most he thought about how he can help in the situation was to listen to what Ved was saying.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ved called his lawyer and told him that he was playing a prank on him and that he did not need to worry. He even made Steve talk to him. He was convinced that it was a joke, and they had their part of laughs. Things seemed to line up pretty well as time was passing.</p>

<p>As everyone came to the room, they looked at Ved as he opened his handbag and took the manuscript out of it. ‘This is what I found yesterday.’ He said.</p>

<p>He told them the entire story of how he started his expedition from old ruins, then just for the sake of it went a bit ahead to find the old Aghori who mysteriously smiled at him. Then, the majestic view Shiva sculpture and hence the temple. The ear-splitting sound, him finding the book and hence the wild tribal running, towards him to kill him.</p>

<p>‘But how did you escape it?’ Steve asked. ‘How did you reach here? It’s practically impossible bro.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know.’ Ved said. ‘Also, doesn’t matter now. I am here’ he said asking him to ignore it.</p>
