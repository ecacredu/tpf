    <p>They came back to the hotel. ‘Hello sir’ greeted the manager. Ved waved at him and sighed his disappointment. Ved being the lead had coordinated with him frequently. After staying there for half a month now, they had got pretty casual with each other.</p>

<p>They came back to their respective rooms. Ved switched on the lights and indicated Steve to put on the heater.</p>

<p>Ved felt restless though. ‘I think we should give it a last try Steve.’ Ved said to his roommate.</p>

<p>‘Bro? It’s ok. We have been doing this last try thing for two days now. It's too late.’ His voice echoed through the washroom. After a long pause, he said pretending to convince.’ Also, we have been advised not to leave our rooms at night. As per reports, it can start snowing any moment now.’ Steve replied from the bathroom while getting fresh. After a long silence. He continued in his gruff voice. ‘We need to get ready. We have our flight back tomorrow morning if you remember.’’</p>

<p>Ved knew he was right and didn’t want to force him. But it was he who held the responsibility of the trip and hence was eager. He made up his mind. He searched for his torch in the dim lit room and packed it. ‘You are coming or should I go alone?’ He asked conformingly.</p>
<p>‘No way bro. I am not. You do as you wish.’ He said thinking it was a joke.</p>
