   <p>Ved was shocked. He was speechless. He preferred to say nothing.</p>

    <p>Manager addressed his discomfort. He chose to divert the topic by himself. ‘At this time sir? It’s 9 PM. Even if you leave where will you go? Hotel room not comfortable sir?’ said the manager.</p>

    <p>Ved was stunned. 9 PM? He took out his cell phone and checked the date. His eyes widened. He was sleeping for the whole day.</p>

    <p>‘And... Are you leaving alone sir? What about your colleagues? Have you had a conversation with them? All ok now?’</p>

    <p>‘No! They aren’t coming with me’ he was quick. Gathering courage to speak further, he said ‘Please take this card. I will find some way. I have an extreme emergency and have to go. And, yes, of course, I have had a talk with them.’ he signaled him to use his card.</p>

    <p>He swiped his card and took his leave from hotel. He surely wasn’t going to go to his own house, as he would be first searched over there. He traveled to Nashik, a city in Maharashtra at his grandfather’s apartment.</p>

    <p>He knew by then, the bodies would be discovered, and the cops would be searching for him.</p>
