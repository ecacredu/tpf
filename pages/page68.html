        <p>‘Everyone has. Everyone uses it at some or the other point of time without realization.’ Yug replied. ‘If I can collect
            memories attached to an external physical object, Do you think subconsciously you were not aware of the whole
            vision you saw?’ Yug asked.</p>

        <p>‘You mean…’</p>

        <p>‘Yes. You had seen the entire day of yours too.’ Yug continued. ‘You are not amongst the one who would run away even
            from the worst situation.’</p>

        <p>Ved was surprised on that comment. Hearing his praise from such a great person, he chose to remain silent.</p>

        <p>‘You stand by right. You will go against all the odds and face them, for truth, even if it means death.’ Yug exclaimed.
            ‘As I said before, You got the manuscript because it was bound to happen.’</p>

        <p>Ved was not entirely convinced. Everything was difficult for him to digest. He had initially preassumed the sage
            to be Maharishi Ved Vyas, the author of Mahabharata, hence committed him to go with him. But soon he got to know
            that it was Yug and not him, who claimed to be his follower.</p>

        <p>Then the sage claimed to have lived a longer than usual life. Finally, he claimed the whole of his clan to be like
            him. Ved carried doubt on his decision now. His thoughts resisted not believing Yug for some reason suddenly.</p>

        <p>‘Is he telling the truth or playing with my mind taking advantage of my psychiatric trauma?’ Ved thought, looking
            at the physically fit brahmin who looked barely in his forties.</p>
