        <p>‘The one who protects the <i>Granth</i> hears instructions in his head. I listen to those too. It is said that they
            are given by Maharishi Ved Vyas.’ Yug clarified.</p>

        <p>Ved sensed another <i>maybe </i>in that sentence. Yug was not certain whether the voice he claimed to hear was of
            Ved Vyas or merely his inner conscious or another miracle by the book itself.</p>

        <p>‘Oh Brahmin you said you have been searching for Ved Vyas since five centuries now. Have you met him at least once?’
            Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘As I have told you before it is not easy to meet Ved Vyas.’ Yug replied. ‘I have not, but I want to and very close
            to, is what I feel.’</p>

        <p>Bzzt… Bzzzzzzt… Bzzzt… Ved looked at his cell vibrating cell phone. Disha was trying to call him continuously since
            last few minutes. It had been around six hours since Disha had left and Yug came to his room.</p>
