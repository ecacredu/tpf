    <p>Ved had no words. He was happy he heard his voice. ‘What the hell is happening?’ He wondered. He was utter less.</p>

    <p>After all the sequence of events, escaping from death, then seeing his friends dead and having the dreadful escape, what he finds out is this. He couldn’t reply much to him.</p>

    <p>‘Hey’ he said whispering. ‘I am okay bro. How are others?’ He asked reassuringly.</p>

    <p>‘Obviously, they are fine? How are you? When can we meet?’ Steve asked his set of questions.</p>

    <p>‘Oh, that's relieving. Listen, stuck somewhere. Will call you back in some time.’</p>

    <p>Ved disconnected the call and looked at Disha with the troubled mind. ‘What is this? What’s happening to me?’ he cried.</p>

    <p>‘Please calm down Ved. I will tell you everything.’ She tried to comfort him. ‘Nobody is dead. They were there itself, searching for you. You went missing. They searched you everywhere Ved.’</p>
