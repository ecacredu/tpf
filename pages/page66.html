        <p>‘Yes, it is true. But it has been passed to me by my clan. I had to protect it as long as I could. And keep it away
            from any human contact.’ Yug told Ved that he had been protecting that manuscript since five centuries, but ultimately,
            Ved got his hands on the book by fate.</p>

        <p>‘Oh Great one, Mind if I ask you a question?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>To Yug’s nod, Ved asked. ‘You said you are alive for beyond five centuries. Doesn’t that mean you are immortal too?’</p>

        <p>‘No people of my clan have an average lifespan of two thousand years. But we perish eventually. So we are mortal.’
            Yug cleared.</p>

        <p>‘But how?’ Ved asked. He was astounded.</p>

        <p>‘An average lifespan of more than a millennium? The whole clan lives that long?’ Ved wondered.</p>

        <p>‘Is it even possible? What sorcery is it? Does magic really exist?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘What is magic according to you?’ Yug asked calmly.</p>

        <p>Ved stayed silent. Yug continued. ‘Magic is what human science doesn’t understand. Or a part of science yet to be
            discovered.’ Yug continued further. ‘Simply put in your terms, It is a higher level understanding and hence the
            application, of science.’</p>

        <p>Ved recalled Yug keeping his hand over the book and hence the corresponding explanation he gave. ‘What science was
            it to touch the book and view the past?’ he asked.</p>
