        <p>‘What does that mean? Even if you had placed it anywhere, any human would have taken it.’ Ved expressed his query.</p>

        <p>‘No, it’s not that simple. There are lots of clauses to that as well. Also, you are capable as well. You are intelligent
            and fearless too.’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p>Ved could understand Yug calling him intelligent as a compliment after viewing his research work, but he did not
            understand the other part. ‘Fearless?’ he asked.</p>

        <p>Yug replied. ‘For an ordinary individual, someone mysteriously standing on the ninth floor on his balcony would have
            been a havoc. But, you reacted quite calmly. You are indeed fearless.’</p>

            would come.’ Ved continued. ‘I was waiting for you.’</p>
