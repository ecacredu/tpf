    <p>‘It looks pretty old, at least a century bro.’ Steve said to Ved. ‘Is it really Mahabharata?’</p>

    <p>‘No it’s older. Look at this chemical formulation.’ Ved said.</p>

    <p>‘This gold trace resembles to shape of a hand.’ Peter added. ‘And these pages, they are so well engineered.’</p>

    <p>Ved smiled. ‘Yes.’ He said. ‘We are going to be famous. Very famous.’ Ved yawned.’ Anyways, I am exhausted now; will rest again for a moment and then hand this over to Indian embassy. Our lawyers will ensure we get a significant amount for the same.’</p>

    <p>‘Yes, I hope we do. But we never know what government would do. Indian government I have heard is full of politics. Will they even consider us bro?’ Steve asked.</p>
