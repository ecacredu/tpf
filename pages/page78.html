        <p>Ved remembered the moment when he was attacked by the local tribals when he had got the book. He had closed his eyes
            expecting everything to end, but that is where everything practically started.</p>

        <p>Ved did the same. Amidst his conversation with Yug, he closed his eyes expecting everything to end. </p>

        <p>‘TINNNNNGG TONGGGGG’ The bell rang.</p>

        <p>Ved opened his eyes. He still saw Yug in front of him. He regretted it being the truth. He slowly walked to the door
            and opened it. It was Disha.</p>
        <p>Ved looked at her. He had a lot of questions for her. Confirming that Yug was not peeking from inside, Ved whispered.
            ‘What did you say on the call? Why do you think so? And How do you even know him?’</p>
        <p>Ved was shocked on Disha’s reply. ‘What call? You were not picking up the call… That’s why I came back here.</p>
