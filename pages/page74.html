        <p>Disha’s words were continuously revolving in Ved’s head. ‘How does Disha even know him?’ he thought again.</p>

        <p>Now Ved’s mind was filled with suspicion. ‘How can you be so sure it is him? Maharishi Vyas that you say you hear
            inside you.’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘The intensive knowledge that the one who instructs me has, points that it is him.’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p>Again Ved did not get a straight answer to his question. ‘But he could not be Vyas?’ Ved asked. ‘There is a possibility,
            isn’t it?’</p>

        <p>‘What do you want to point at?’ Yug asked. ‘Do you not believe that Maharishi Vyas is alive?’</p>

        <p>Ved was stunned. Yug asked it too directly. Ved replied, ‘I didn’t mean it in that way of sage. But what if all this
            is just a coincidence?’ Yug seemed too much confident on the existence of Vyas.</p>

        <p>‘No it is not. I am sure you will get answers to most of your questions as we reach to my village.’ Yug seemed persistent.
            Ved now saw through it.</p>

        <p>‘Will I get to know how I escaped death from those barbaric tribals? Or who would have killed my friends?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘Yes. As we reach there, I will arrange our meeting with the head of my clan. I am sure he will help you as much
            as he can.’ Yug replied.</p>
