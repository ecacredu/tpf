        <p>Some pieces of the puzzle were still missing. As Ved thought he started getting more confused. Yug had only answered
            those questions which were associated with his story that Ved had told him. ‘All the explanations could altogether
            be fake like Disha said’ Ved thought. ‘There was a possibility that Yug could be a con.’</p>
        <p>Every time Ved looked at Yug, he remembered Disha’s words. Maybe he was being followed by Yug right from the start.
            Maybe all the answers are well planned as well.</p>

        <p>‘What took you so long to find me?’ Ved asked. ‘Considering your agility and magic, could you not have found me earlier?’</p>

        <p>Yug was surprised by such sudden question, but he replied instantly. ‘I searched for you everywhere. It took me seven
            days to figure out that your location, after which I met you.’ He paused. ‘Also magic, as I said, is just a higher
            application of science and can't do everything, Everyone who does it has his mastery in a particular field.’</p>

        <p>As the conversation was heading ahead, Ved was getting more and more doubtful. ’When do we plan to leave tomorrow?’
            Ved asked considering to plan how much time has left to rebel. He knew in physical combat; he won't be able to
            do anything to Yug and least what he could do is postpone the going to the next day and figure out something.</p>

        <p>But resisting it, Yug replied. ‘No, we have less time. Now that I am here, They can find us at any moment. We should
            leave now itself as soon as possible.’</p>
