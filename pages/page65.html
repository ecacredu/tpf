        <p>‘Yes. I assumed you knew it? Were you not the one in my dreams?’ Ved asked panicking.</p>

        <p>‘Come again?’ Yug seemed confused.</p>

        <p>‘It was around a week before when I got this manuscript. Since then, I have heard voices in my head while sleeping,
            saying <i>I am coming</i>’ Ved said. ‘I thought it was you.’</p>

        <p>‘I have no role to play there.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p>‘In that case, I already knew someone was going to come’ With cold eyes, Ved explained to him that he could not decide
            if the one coming would be with or against him. In fear, he was so afraid that he did not open the door for anyone
            until he heard Disha’s voice that day earlier.</p>

        <p>‘Maybe the manuscript pre-informed you of my arrival. I am myself not aware of its whole power.' Yug said.</p>

        <p>‘But you are the one to whom it belongs right? You should know what happened.’ Ved asked.</p>
