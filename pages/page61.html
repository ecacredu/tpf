        <p>‘I have no answer to that. You have to come with me and find it out by yourself.’ Yug said.</p>

        <p>‘Who will be answering my questions? Whom are we going to? Are we going to Ved Vyas?’ Ved asked desperately because
            he simply needed answers and wanted to find out if immortality actually existed.</p>

        <p>‘As I have told you. Maharishi Vyas is not that simple to meet. We will be going to the head of my clan. He will
            probably answer all your questions.’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p>Yug said <i>probably</i> while speaking and Ved noticed it. He understood that even Yug was unsure of some things.
            He did not want to stretch on the topic and push embarrassment on him. But his mind was disturbed. It did not
            seem to him that Yug was lying, but it was simply not possible for Ved to digest everything.</p>

        <p>‘So, What I saw was future?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘A possible future.’ Yug reanswered.</p>

        <p>Ved tried to, but he couldn’t understand it. ‘But is it possible?’ He thought.</p>
        <p>‘Can anyone, do it? Can anyone actually change the future?’ Ved asked reluctantly. ‘If I see future, I see it because
            it’s going to happen. But then it doesn’t happen. Meaning what I saw was not future?’</p>

        <p>Hearing the paradox from Ved, Yug giggled a bit and said. ‘But what if these sequences of events were meant to happen?
            What you saw was not future, but a possibility, like a warning.’ </p>
