    <p>As he walked, Ved was stunned. ‘What just happened?’ he thought. ‘He knew all the time that I was here?’</p>

    <p>Seeing his vanishing figure in the jungle, Ved decided to stay still and let it go.</p>

    <p>Foot holding himself, Ved then walked towards the lamp seeing for whom and what he was praying. Just when he looked at the moon, his eyes rolled out in excitement.</p>

    <p>‘OH MY! How on earth can we miss such a thing?’ he exclaimed.</p>

    <p>The view was just breathtaking. Call that another fabulous creation of God. Amidst the huge mountain partially blocking the moon, he saw a godly face carved on it. It seemed like Lord Shiva himself was sitting and meditating under a huge waterfall. He went speechless.</p>

    <p>Ved was well aware of the Indian culture and hence various Indian Vedic scripts. He suddenly remembered his grandfather’s words clearly.</p>

    <div style="text-align:center;font-style: italic;">
        <p>Carved by thousands, he who holds the holy river in his jatas will bring forth the one who will decide it all. For the one who sees it, will have no choice left but to flow towards it. It will decide for him, what he will be.</p>
