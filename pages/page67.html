        <p>Confused in chaos with a constant question<i> why me?</i> Ved continued. ‘Also, Where do I fit in this higher level
            of science? I got the <i>Granth</i> accidentally, and so simply, without any struggle. I feel I don’t even deserve
            it. Back when you said I took a perfect decision? Would your chosen one run away from a situation, like I did?’</p>

        <p>‘When I placed my hand on the manuscript and focused, what I scientifically did was to gather the traces of memories
            it preserved and envision it.’ Yug explained.</p>

        <p>As he saw Ved sincerely listening to him, Yug continued further. ’Every knowledge that you seek roams around the
            universe around you and is interlinked. You just need to focus to perceive it.’</p>

        <p>Ved was shocked. Though seemed impossible, What Yug said did make sense. If knowledge were going to limit on what
            one knows, No discovery hence advancement in science would have taken place. Gathering memory traces seemed practically
            impossible, but if Yug claimed to do it and gave him actual demo for the same, ‘Maybe it is possible’ he thought.</p>

        <p>However, Even if it were true, Ved, an ordinary individual, did not understand where he fit in the extraordinary
            lesser known world Yug was talking about. ‘But how does that justify me being the chosen one?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘You have that power too!’ Yug continued.</p>

        <p>Ved was shocked. ‘What?’ he asked.</p>
