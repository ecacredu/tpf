    <p>Ved went into a deep sleep. It was probably one of the most satisfactory and peaceful nights of his life. He had no regrets or worries. But amidst the dark tiring night, lights in a room parallel to his were still on. Three people held a personal meeting. They were nervous about how things will go if The Mahabharata was handed to Indian Embassy. </p>

    <p>The three knew the importance of the manuscript and wanted it to be given to Archaeological Department in the United States, where they studied presently. They knew they would be getting a lot more fame and money if they do it. One of them also suggested that they should sell the manuscript in the black market.</p>

    <p>They even called people across the globe to find out a possible escape out of the situation. After a long meeting, their greed turned fearless and insane. They drew the conclusion that Ved had enough power and rights legally to not listen to anything that they will say. Stealing and selling it in black market was not feasible as well. So they decided to take a life instead.</p>

    <p>As the three came to the room where Ved was sleeping, Peter held a pillow in his hand and was prepared to kill Ved to death. Steve and Hussain were ready for any unexpected event that might be encountered.</p>
