   <p>As Ved looked at the Sage meditating and seeking for answers which Ved wanted for himself, he also thought about how disappointed he was because the sage is not Ved Vyas. Meanwhile, he saw his phone. Disha was trying to call him. But as he did not want him to disturb the process anywhere at this moment in time, he canceled the call again and texted her that he will call her in some time.</p>

<p>To disturb the silence of quiet atmosphere of that room, Yug opened his eyes and said calmly. ‘It was a perfect decision.' </p>

<p>‘huh?’</p>

<p>Looking at confused Ved. Yug said. ‘It was a glimpse of a possible future that you saw.’</p>

<p>Ved was clueless of what he meant. ‘Can you please elaborate?'</p>

<p>Looking at tangled Ved, Yug continued. ‘You had a choice Ved. To believe or not to believe. Had you not believed what you saw, it would have just disappeared. And then.’</p>

<p>Ved looked dumbfounded as he had no idea of what he was hearing. Yug then started telling him the alternative sequence of event that would have occurred based on his choice of Ved’s decision.</p>
