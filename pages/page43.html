    <p>‘The manuscript did.’ The <i>Brahmin</i> said pointing at it.</p>

    <p>Ved was even more confused now. He said, ‘Huh? How can a book save me?’</p>

    <p>‘It is not a usual book. The manuscript has spiritual bindings on it.’</p>

Also remembering an important part of this conversation, he asked. ‘Oh Great Sage, Can I ask you another question that bothers me?’</p>

    <p>As the Sage nodded affirmatively, Ved continued ‘You said I have to go with you and that I have some purpose to serve. What is it?’</p>

    <p>‘Some things are meant to be let for time to uncover. You will get to know soon.’ He replied.</p>

    <p>‘But why me? I got the book accidently.’ Ved asked.</p>
