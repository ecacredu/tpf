        <p>Yug meanwhile looked around Ved’s things. He looked at all the material, the messy papers, his files and the old
            reference books. ‘These are your grandfather’s?’ asked Yug holding an old book in his hand.</p>

        <p>Ved nodded.</p>

        <p>‘He was an archaeologist too?’ Yug asked.</p>

        <p>‘Yes. The best. And I wish to become like him.’ Ved replied.</p>

        <p>‘Yes, he was. The very fact that he knew the verse shows his intensive research.’ Yug said remembering the verse
            Ved said his grandfather had told him. ‘The temple is very sacred, and its location is not mentioned anywhere.
            I wonder where he got to hear that. He had a pretty strong network I assume.’</p>

        <p>Ved felt proud. He genuinely admired his grandfather. </p>

        <p>‘But how do you know I am the one?’ Ved was persistent. He wanted answers. With a mere <i>I will come with you</i>,
            Ved had put a pause to his ten years of professional career for something he did not have any clue about. At
            first, he had assumed the <i>brahmin</i> to be Ved Vyas, but he was disappointed later.</p>
