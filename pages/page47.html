   <p>‘Five… Five Centuries?’ Ved was startled. ‘What is your age oh great sage?’</p>

<p>‘More than five centuries.’ Yug smiled and joyfully indicated Ved about the irrelevancy of his question.</p>

<p>Ved smiled and perceived the response. He understood that the things are not as usual as it seemed. Yug claimed to have lived more than five centuries, but he said he is not immortal. Mortality is when you can die and free yourself from the material world. He further asked. ‘Could you answer one last question of mine?’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ Yug replied.</p>

<p>‘How were my friends resurrected? Can the dead be brought back to life? Or was it just an illusion or a dream?’ Ved asked.</p>

<p>‘No… From what I understand, <i>It was neither reality nor a dream</i>.’ Yug said.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by that?’</p>

<p>‘Give me some time. I will explain to you.’ </p>

<p>Yug sat down while taking the manuscript in his hand. He sat in the lotus position and keeping a palm of his on the book, started meditating. After few minutes, Ved realized that Yug was in extreme state of focus. </p>
