        <p>He had answered as expected and it grew Ved’s suspicion even further. The mysterious Brahmin told him everything
            related to what he can make on his own and Ved couldn't question on.</p>

        <p>‘But I am very tired right now. I think I need some rest.’ Ved said.</p>

        <p>Yug noticed a sudden change in Ved’s behavior. ‘What is it that you heard on the phone?’ Yug asked as he had naturally
            sensed the sudden tonality and attitude change of Ved towards him.</p>

        <p>‘No. What about the phone?’ Ved was nervous now. He was caught he thought.</p>

        <p>‘Ved. Carry no doubt that I am on the side of truth.’ Yug said. ‘I do not know what you heard on the phone. But you
            seem nervous.’</p>

        <p>Yug continued. ‘After leaving the hotel, you stopped the car near a jungle and had buried the manuscript. You left
            the manuscript considering it a curse.’</p>

        <p>Ved was surprised. ‘How does he know it?’ Ved thought.</p>
