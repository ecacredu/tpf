        <p>‘Oh <i>Brahmin</i>, I see no answer to my question there? Can anyone change the future?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘Yes. People say your future is in your hand. They do mean it. You shape what you become. The way you think, and
            act determines the future.’ Yug replied.</p>

        <p>‘But if it goes by how you say, Then I changed future of 4 people including myself? My friends are not dead.’ Ved
            asked remembering his friends.</p>

        <p>‘No, you changed the future of the whole world.’</p>

        <p>Looking at Ved’s dazzled face, Yug continued ‘Each and every one of us, is linked. Every individual’s actions trigger
            actions of others in the world and vice versa.’ He smiled as he said.</p>

        <p>Ved understood what Yug’s point. He again chose to be silent. </p>

        <p>Yug decided to break the silence. ‘Do you mind giving me a glass of water?’</p>

        <p>‘Yes sure.’ Ved rushed to the kitchen to get the same. Looking at the clean kitchen, he felt nostalgic. ‘Disha’ he
            remembered. </p>

        <p>He took out his cell phone kept on silent mode to see two missed calls and a message from her asking him to call
            back. He thought of calling her, but that would rather be time-consuming he thought. He texted her back. ‘Will
            call you back in some time Disha. Sorry to keep you waiting…’</p>

        <p>‘Ved?’ Yug called him, Ved rushed back to his room and handed him the glass.</p>
