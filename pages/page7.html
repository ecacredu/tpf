        ‘Knock knock!!’ shouted the door.
    </p>

    <p>The glass in his hand slipped, breaking down and spilling water all over the floor. Trying to stay as calm as possible, he was stunned as he saw everything going out of his hands. Maybe they have found him, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>Ved was too afraid to open it. He just peeked at the door from inside. With curtains closed, he had kept the lights off for nobody to notice him. Like his dense dark candle lit study room, he chose to remain silent. The situation was tense enough for him to think that the whole world was after him.    
    </p>
    <p>This time the door knocked vigorously, like the bumps of fist bawled. Someone was trying to force himself in, while the door stood between Ved and him.
    </p>
    <p>‘Thud thud!!’</p>
    <p>‘I know you are inside, Open the door, or I’ll break it.’ said a soft, familiar voice.</p>
    <p>That voice!</p>
