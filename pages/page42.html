   <p>‘I don’t know. I was in my mid age when grandfather lost his life. Never got a chance to ask such stuff at that time.’</p>

    <p>‘What was your grandfather’s name? Also, state me your name.’</p>

    <p>‘Bhaskar Trivedi, That’s my grandfather's name.’ As he spoke, his words reflected respect for his grandfather. ‘And, my name is Ved.’</p>

    <p>‘Ved Trivedi it is.’ The great sage said addressing him. ‘What question do you have in your mind?’</p>

    <p>‘TRRRINGG TRRRINGG … TRRRINGG TRRRINGG’</p>

    <p>The interaction was broken all of sudden by the cell phone ring. It was Disha. He looked at the time. It was nine already. He had to leave, but some things are more important he thought and canceled the call. </p>

    <p>He sent her a text message. ‘Disha, at a critical part of the research. Ttyl.’ He put the phone on silent and kept it aside.</p>

    <p>‘Extremely Sorry for the noise.’ Ved continued. ‘Everything is changed in my life since I got this book. I was about to die. I was prepared to die. I closed my eyes for so. But I magically came back to our hotel room and saw the dreadful view.’</p>
