   <p>He looked at his current research progress. He then immediately called several people from the University and sent them samples for decoding. There were strange things about the book. The writing seemed to be written in multiple slots of time. One slot he even estimated to be more than 3 centuries old and others were relatively as fresh as hundred years. It looked as if someone was still writing the book.</p>

    <p>This acknowledged the myth that the author of Mahabharata, ‘Maharishi Ved Vyas’ is assumed to be immortal. Was it really Vyas?
