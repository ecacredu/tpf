   <p>‘There is no such thing as an accident. The manuscript chose you. The fact that you saw the Shiva sculpture and the temple are in itself a huge thing. Though being so obvious, The marvelous sculpture can't be perceived by the eyes of an ordinary individual.’</p>
    <p>‘The manuscript chose me?’</p>

    <p>‘Yes. Or else you would not have got it in the first place. It was a matter of few minutes in which the book was collected by you, and your traces disappeared from near the temple, and I lost it.’</p>

    <p>‘What do you mean by that, oh great sage?’</p>

    <p>‘The fact is that I was there in the forest at that time, being chased by someone for this manuscript. I could have been killed, and the script would have been taken, but I reached the temple safely. And as I said, the temple is not perceptible to others. They lost the sight of me and so the book, which I then placed there to keep it safe for the time being and recollect later. But when I came back, the book was missing.’</p>

    <p>‘You kept the book there? Do you mean… ’</p>

    <p>‘Yes. The jolting sound you heard was me when I landed on the mountain. And someone running behind you might have been the one’s chasing me.’</p>
