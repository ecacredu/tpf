        <p>Ved was thoughtless for a moment and had no argument to frame. ‘Even if humans are unpredictable and they lose their
            mind in greed. To such an unimaginable extent?’ he thought to himself.</p>

        <p>‘Can we trust anyone?’ Ved asked sarcastically.</p>

        <p>‘Let me help you with your thoughts, To be honest, I can’t say for sure, but I don’t think their inner selfishness
            or greed would have been the only factor that could be held responsible.’</p>

        <p>Ved looked confused and waited for Yug to continue.</p>

        <p>‘As I was telling you. The Manuscript, it has spiritual binding across it. There are things beyond what you know.
            Even in the twenty-first century, On this material side of the world, humans are yet to unleash their real potential.’
            Yug replied.</p>

        <p>Ved looked at the book. ‘It generated greed in them?’ He asked himself looking at it. If it were true, his mind couldn’t
            decide if the book was good or evil. He chose to ask the same. ‘So, Is this script cursed?’</p>

        <p>‘It is. For the ones who wish to use it for their selfish motives.’ Yug calmly replied.</p>

        <p>Ved was quick and asked in doubt. ‘Then why did you not let the one’s following you take it? It would have murdered
            them as well.’</p>
