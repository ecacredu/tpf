<p>She knew Ved was sensible enough to understand things. She felt it is ok to let him have his space. ‘Ok. I understand your concern. I am staying in the hotel on the opposite road for today. We leave back tomorrow morning?’</p>

<p>‘Your grandfather would have been proud of you today’ she said.</p>
