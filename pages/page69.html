        <p>Though deep in his heart, Ved wanted an affirmative answer to his question. He had not told anyone yet, about actual
            reasons for planning the trip to Uttarakhand, where it all happened. The reason for which he was so desperate
            for the expedition, Desperate enough to walk out alone in those dense forests that night, even at the cost of
            his life.</p>

        <p>He looked at his vibrating cell phone. It displayed five missed calls and two new messages. </p>

        <p>It was high time to decide. If Ved took a decision to go and would tell the same to Disha, she would definitely oppose
            his idea to leave without informing the place he was heading to. ‘Though I even don’t know where we will be going.’
            Ved thought.</p>

        <p>He yet again decided to ignore his mobile. Disha was trying to call him for three hours. Naturally, she cared about
            him. But he still felt the conversation with the sage was more important than anything in the world. He hoped
            to get answers he had been searching for his entire childhood.</p>

        <p>But some questions needed to be answered right away. ‘Oh sage, Where will we be going?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘We will be going to a place called Vrukshavrundavan.' It is where my clan resides.’</p>

        <p>‘Will I get an answer to all my questions there?’ Ved asked in doubt.</p>

        <p>‘Yes probably.’ Yug said.</p>
