        <p>Yug was silent. ‘In my vision, it was not the <i>Granth </i>that killed them.’ Yug continued. ‘I do not know the
            reason for the same. I saw only darkness and could hear terror. I could not see what murdered them<i>.'</i> Even
            Yug looked terrified as he remembered the roars. Yug skipped the topic and said. ‘Also, In this universe, there
            are forces with a lot more strength than you can imagine. If something is sealed and bound, the seal can be broken
            as well. To express in your language, They have similar <i>mantras</i> to decode it. Don’t underestimate their
            power.’

        <p>‘Oh Brahmin, but you seem very mighty, A simple jump of yours as you said, made a dent on a mountain.’ Ved said.
            ‘Can someone be stronger than you that you have to run from them?’</p>

        <p>‘I was chased by a group, not an individual. Even if I am powerful, I couldn’t have sustained them all. And, it was
            not about me and my life. God forbid if they had got their hands on the <i>Granth, </i>the world would have turned
            upside down in even a week till now.<i>’</i></p>

        <p>‘But who are they?’ Ved asked.</p>

        <p>‘You will get to know everything. Just wait for the right time.’ Yug said. ‘However, I am glad they did not get their
            hands on the manuscript.’</p>

        <p>Ved was overwhelmed, hearing the power of the book and feared at the same time. ‘But how did I end up getting the
            <i>Granth</i>? You said the temple was not perceivable by eyes of even those mighty people following you. But
            I saw it, and that was where I got it. Why me?’</p>
