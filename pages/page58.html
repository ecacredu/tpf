        <p class="capital">‘It was a possible future?’ Ved was thoughtless.</p>
        <p>‘Yes.’ Yug Replied.</p>

        <p>Ved had no clue what Yug was saying. Everything went over his head. Though things were hard to believe, what he had faced and seen was real. With Yug giving him an explanation, Ved had no alternative option but to accept what he was saying. </p>

        <p>However, he couldn’t bear the thought that his friends could go against him, and even try to kill him. Furthermore, even if Peter and Hussain would force, Ved thought, Steve will never stand for something like that. He was not only his subordinate but a close friend as well.</p>

        <p>He had chosen to listen to him earlier, as he says, but he resisted ‘Steve is like my brother. Others are good friends as well. I don’t think they can even think of doing something like this.’</p>

        <p>‘It might be hard for you to believe, but everyone wears a mask on his face. Each and every individual ultimately lives for himself Ved. You shall realize this soon as we progress ahead, nobody is pure hearted. As said in <i>Puranas</i>, in this era, everyone will ultimately perish thinking for themselves.’</p>
