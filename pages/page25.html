    <p>‘bluhh Bluhh BLUhh’ the tribal sounds were coming closer. Their voice resonated through the cave. Fear struck his mind. Without second thoughts he inverted the bag and emptied it. He pushed the book half inside and waved the bag on his back. Getting hold of the torch, he started running back towards the entrance.</p>

    <p>The tribal people were still making those horrifying recursive sounds indicating their discomfort towards unknown. They were disturbing animals and birds further which were adding to their noises as well.</p>

    <p>Being tensed, Ved tried to run as fast as possible. He came near the entrance to see that it had started snowing. He leaned out of the cave to see them all. His eyes popped out. Even in that dark, snowy night, fearlessly hundreds of tribal were running towards him. They had their weapons in their hand. Some had held handmade fire torches, and others were carrying metal knives and bones.</p>

    <p>His senses were stunned. He looked back, but he knew he would be cornered inside anyways.</p>

    <p>He tried to run aside, but they were everywhere, approaching him from every direction. Even from this distance, he could feel their blood thirst. They were angry and afraid for the intervention.</p>
