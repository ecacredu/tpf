   <p>‘Hello, you there? Yes, I am his grandfather’s place now. I was right. He is here.’ Disha talked on the phone to the recipient.</p>

    <p>Ved felt very alone. He knew he would be held guilty. But he was anyways going to be caught someday or the other.</p>

    <p>‘Yes, he’s okay and sitting in front of me. He’s okay.’ She continued.</p>

    <p>‘Yes talk to him.’ She raised the phone towards him.</p>

    <p>He was already feeling uneasy and signaled that he doesn't want to take the call. He was not going to talk to anyone. Nobody in this world would trust him. After the current sequence of events, he even doubted if Disha believed him.</p>

    <p>‘No’ he shook his head again in discomfort.</p>

    <p>She held the phone aside for a moment, came closer to him and said ‘This is important for you, Ved. Please do it’.</p>

    <p>He was not going to listen to her. She forced the phone to his ears.</p>

    <p>‘Ved, What the hell bro?’ said a familiar gruff voice.</p>

    <p>Ved was astounded. It was Steve. He couldn’t respond. He was speechless.</p>
